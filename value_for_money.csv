14," My parents were flying home and my father called Southwest to check in. He was told that they were going to be bumped from the flight and could either fly on another day without paying or they could “upgrade” their fare for over $400 to remain on the flight, causing them to have to put out money they don’t necessarily have. They are retired and on a fixed income and they had to get home due to pet sitting obligations. When I talked to the Southwest representative, the only thing they would do for my parents is upgrade their boarding numbers. Once they got to the airport this “overbooked” flight was allowing standby passengers on the plane and there were several open seats. Not sure if this has ever happened to anyone else with Southwest but it sounds strange to me."
59,"   Horrible experience. Our original flight time was 11:30am. They delayed it to 2:00pm. We were fine until we arrived at the airport. They delayed our flight to 7:28pm! That's about 8 hours after we were supposed to leave. The weather wasn't even bad. It was beautiful outside and there was no storms at all. The delay was due to ""Air traffic control"" even though no other airline such as Delta or United had delayed or canceled flights. After waiting an hour at the airport, they cancelled our flight and would not give us a refund at first. We had a week long trip ahead of us that we couldn't go on because of Southwest. We also saw families of 8 going to Disney World Orlando and you can't get a refund from that either. Now we are trying to cancel everything we had planned for the trip. We lost a lot of money on this. I wish I could give 0 stars."
95,"  Customer Service was poor on my last flight. I was flying from Panama City to New York (LGA) with a connection in Nashville on a Saturday. My first flight was fine (in flight beverages and entertainment not great, but I have come to expect this with Southwest). My second flight got delayed 3/4 times before ultimately being cancelled at 8.30pm. Again, not usually an issue, but they were unable to rebook me until Monday. The service desk was not able to get me on a flight the next day at all and also wouldn't let me get on standby for any of the Sunday flights. I was willing to accept this, however, I had no place to stay in Nashville. When I requested a comped or discounted hotel room (especially considering I was going to need somewhere to stay for two nights) they declined siting weather as the reason for cancelation, therefore they didn't need to provide hotel accommodation. While I understand what's in their contract, it is an absolutely awful customer experience to be stranded in a city where you have no connections and are essentially forced to pay for a hotel or sleep in an airport for over 24 hours. I would have expected them to either pay for my hotel or try a bit harder to get my on a flight the following day and not two days later. When this has happened to me on other airlines, they have always provided a hotel room free of charge and tried their best to get me on a flight the very next day, regardless of the reason for the cancellation. I ultimately had to cancel my return flight and get a rental car to get myself home. (at an additional cost of several hundred dollars). I will think twice before booking with Southwest again. You could be out much more money than you planned if there is any unexpected weather."
130,"  I never write reviews but this experience was so tragic for me I felt like I needed to let off some steam. Some backstory - I just graduated college and am supporting my fiancé as he finishes college. After doing year-round school, I have about $2,000 to my name in addition to student debt I still owe. Since we are paying for our own honeymoon, we wanted something very affordable. We were planning on just going somewhere local when my fiancé's parents shared a 48 hour deal for Southwest tickets to go to Hawaii. They offered roundtrip tickets to 4 islands for under $350. We were ecstatic! Since my fiancé was saving for a ring I was in charge of purchasing the flights. I hurried to purchase them but then we found out housing was pretty expensive so we switched out flight to another island on the deal. Little did I know switching made the deal invalid. This wasn't mentioned in the email. I did notice it cost extra but thought the deal was still on there so the total couldn't be too much (this was my first time scheduling a flight and I was under time pressure so I was a bit naïve). After paying the difference, I looked a the confirmation email and saw that the total was $1250! I was working so I rushed to an office and got a hold of customer service and they told me that piece of information about changing flight locations. Apparently a lot of people were experiencing the same issue. I started crying explaining that I had no idea the deal wasn't applied and if there was any way I could get my money back. They said that if I canceled I could only get flight credit. I hung up and called my fiancé right away. I was bawling my eyes out explaining how I had messed up our honeymoon and we could never afford the trip at full cost. After that phone call I had to go back to work like everything was okay. I know I was a bit naïve but I still feel scammed out of my honeymoon. Please be careful trusting any deal Southwest Airlines promotes because there's probably a catch somewhere."
133," | Upon family boarding my daughter and I sat in the first 2 rows of the aircraft, we boarded the plane early. I put both our carry ons above us. I was soon interrupted by an un-helpful, nasty flight attendant stating you need to get you bag up or I have to check it. I quickly got my bag in and it fit fine, the woman watched me struggle with no help. Then after the plane had fully been boarded someone boarded the plane that also wanted their carry on to fit, my bag was then removed and placed further in back to place their bag where mine was. After drinks were served my daughter and I weren’t able to finish our drinks as a different flight attendant wanted to take our garbage and said we weren’t allowed to finish our drinks. When we were leaving the plane I asked the flight attendant where my bag was and I was told they didn’t know, and now I we had to wait until the entire aircraft un-boarded so I could get my bag. Once I was able to locate my bag it was in the exact position it originally was in but further back in the aircraft. My daughter and I were treated very poorly as we exited the aircraft by the flight attendant with a snarky, condescending tone “have a nice day”. Not sure how I feel about flying Southwest anymore with my family. We spent a lot of money on tickets and if we boarded early our bags should have had priority over the late comers and we should have been able to finish our drinks, and throw the garbage out when ready."
145," |  I can’t fly to Chicago for two days due to a rescheduled flight. For the first time we got on a plane and everyone just dropped us off and said that you were leaving tomorrow, and the next day they promised a direct flight to Chicago, but again they outplayed everything and changed the flight 3-4 hours before departure! Now I need to fly with a transfer to Dallas. I paid money for this! Is this an airline or a taxi on call? If you are saving your time, don't fly with this airline."
149," |  In 2007 Southwest served: 64.9 million cans of soda, juices, and water 11.3 million alcoholic beverages 6.1 million bags of pretzels 103.8 million bags of peanuts 14 million snackpacks 32 million other snacks Just think how much money Southwest would save if they stopped offering all those ""free"" drinks but then the public would go crazy.  Our beverage service has been canceled on probably 8 out of the last 10 flights I have been on.  And no I don't fly the same place so its not likely due to a specific route. But - if you do the math - Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year.  An average soda costs about $0.75 - $1.00 for the airlines, once you factor in the cost of the drink itself (they purchase cans), the cup, and the ice (which isnt much).  On average a flight has about 150 passengers - that's easily $112 - $150 they can put in their pocket when they ""cancel"" beverage service - and that's assuming each passenger only has one drink. On a recent flight (the one I'm on as I write this) - we were once again denied this ""freebie"" service in the name of supposed ""turbulence"" despite a relatively smooth flight.  I've heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision, so I asked. When I asked about this, instead of simply answering my question, letting me know that the captain made the decision, etc. the flight attendant said something like ""let me find out"".   A few minutes later, the captain came on and ""explained"" why he felt it was important to cancel service - essentially providing an excuse for why they did this.  When I asked for the captain's name, so i could verify this with SWA customer service, I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me ""were not going to do that"" and refused to give me his name. He also threatened that they would ""divert the plane""  although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat, not yelling or anything.  I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear - can't have more than one passenger figure out the little secret. Although I dont know what they are so worried about.  Most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience, let alone do anything that could actually make a difference (like report this on social media or via customer service). But still you dont have to ""hide"" and refuse to provide your name if you aren't doing anything wrong.  So this is all being done in the name of ""safety"" - lets go with that. "
161,"  I had a horrible trip. I booked a trip from Oakland Ca. to Savannah Ga. in Nov. 2022. I HATE flying early, so I booked a flight that had a reasonable, late-morning departure and paid the extra money for a better schedule. About a week before my trip in April of 2023, Southwest canceled my flights and rebooked my whole trip. So, I had to get up at 3.30am to be at the airport by 4.30am for my new take-off time of 5.55am. Exactly what I didn't want and paid extra to avoid. There was no refund for my extra payment when they forced me onto the early undesirable schedule. Then.... On my return home from Savannah, our plane was delayed taking off at the Savannah airport. It turns out the fuel truck for our plane didn't have enough fuel in it. Seriously. So they went and got more fuel and then refuelled our plane which caused a delay to our connection in Houston. We would have had 9 minutes (given the delay for fuelling) to catch our flight in Houston, but Southwest elected to keep the plane to Oakland on time and leave us behind. Great. Now we are rebooked through Southwest for a flight the next day and we are in Houston overnight. And guess what? I have to get on a plane at 6.15am which is exactly why I paid extra money for my original schedule to avoid. The representative at the Houston airport was really nice (Angie G.) and we got a hotel voucher and a $200 Southwest voucher. But this just isn't enough. I'm arriving 16 hours late. I'm staying in a city overnight that I don't care to be in, and cutting my sleep for the second time in a week to keep a flight schedule that I didn't authorize or sign up for. I paid my pet sitter $200 to stay the night in my home and take care of my pets unexpectedly for the extra night. Where is the actual compensation for the 16 hours of my life that I spent overnight in Houston? I had to eat. I had to pay my pet sitter. I lost sleep and essentially, I lost an entire day of rest at home before my work week. This is just awful. I don't know what is going on with this airline, but I have no interest in your voucher to plan a trip with you ever. So......maybe it's time to think about what is actually fair in this awful situation that you created?"
172," | I have been flying out to Colorado Spring every month for the past 7 months for medical reasons and almost all my Southwest flights are delayed which is costing me more money on wasted hotels, rental cars and stress. The only thing I can count on is them being late. They are rarely on time. Their flight times are merely suggestions not actual times you can count on."
194, |  I have had more than one issue with Southwest the past 3 times and am absolutely disgusted. I was forced to give up my seat to other people after I boarded first as an A class member. Then the airline lost my luggage on my flight home because it turns out they decided not to put it on the plane and when I was told it would arrive and I would be contacted I wasn't. I was called at 12am and woken up. Then I had booked a flight home Dec 22-29 to fly home after life saving surgery to spend Christmas with my family until my flight was canceled twice so I ended up having to spend Christmas alone and lost money due to paid appointments thanks to Southwest. I rebooted my flight and requested assistance which was not given after I specifically told them I couldn't lift per Dr. Orders but didn't get help until second time where I had to go through security again andI had to pay fora carry on bag. I was told I would get a flight credit due to SW canceling my trip because they sent my mom one. When I called to ask about it again they told me I don't get one after I had been waiting for the email I was promised. I am beyond disgusted as a customer and if the situation is not handled I will not be using SW again and will make sure to tell everyone I know not to use them either. They are a dishonest company who doesn't care about their customers or taking care of them as promised. I understand mistakes happen but what happened to me is not acceptable and won't be tolerated. I deserve respect and for SW to keep their word.  I'm tired of being told no one will do anything for me. I have flown SW for 15yrs with no problems until recently when it been nothing but awful and I'm considering switching airlines from now on.
200," I was scheduled to fly out of Omaha Nebraska on December 26 at 12:45 p.m. My flight was delayed twice, and then eventually canceled. This has been quite a fiasco. Southwest offered no help whatsoever to the people who were on these flights. I waited in line at the airport for two hours to get a refund on my flight. When I finally reached the agent, I was offered a $200 voucher that would expire within 12 months, however, I was told that they could not refund my money at that time. I would have to call their customer service line. I have tried calling, been unsuccessful have been on hold and disconnected six times in total have spent 30 hours on hold. Just trying to get a refund for a flight that this airline themselves canceled. Reason for cancellation was not leather related. It was due to the fact that Southwest agents overbooked flights that they had no crew to fly. I will never in my life flying Southwest again three times I have flown Southwest I have had issues every time. This is an absolutely horrible, horrible airline. The true sadness for myself is that I was going to see my two grandsons that I haven’t seen in nearly 4 years. Also going to see my mother who has had stage four cancer. This airline has done nothing for anybody to reconcile the cost, the heartache, the time that we have wasted, and that has been stolen from us. For those future travelers, do yourself a favor and even if you have to pay a little bit more for a different flight also. Do not fly Southwest airlines."
206," |  Flight delays because of lack of Staffing, long wait times of just sitting on the plane for hours waiting to see if they are going to decide to fly the plane only to cancel after waiting for 8 hours and this is not due to bad weather only, because employees don't want to work then. They lost my luggage, I never received my luggage I was wearing the same clothes for 4 days only to catch a flight home, and on the change over, still no employees. Flight canceled after being delayed every hour until after 8 hours they decide to cancel which left me stranded 12 hours away from home, which caused me to get a rental car get a hotel drive home on borrowed money, because I hadn't intended on spending that much money due to their incompetence."
214," | We are family of three (myself, husband and our infant) and frequent Southwest travelers since last 7 years. We were scheduled to fly out to and fro to Dallas from LGA on Thursday (Dec 22, 2022). Before we even started to the airport our flight got cancelled. It makes total sense given the circumstances of thunderstorm just the previous day. We got our flights rebooked for Saturday (Dec 24, 2022). The rebooked flight had stopover at Chicago (MDW) before reaching to DAL. Right before boarding the flight at LGA, the gate agent informed us about the cancelled flight from MDW to DAL. Since, we did not have a place to stay in MDW, we cancelled the whole trip and informed the gate agent about our decision. However, our bags got checked in and could not be taken out from the flight. For the next two days - Sunday and Monday I have been going to the airport and standing in line for 4-6 hrs on each day because no one responds to the phone. My wife has been on phone to get hold of an agent for almost 4 hrs everyday but in vain. Following are the major issues with Southwest: 1. In the name of winter storm there are coming with lame excuses. There is impact of storm from Wednesday till Friday. Every major airline except Southwest recovered from it and resumed their operations. However, Southwest has major operational meltdown everywhere. This is fact ! 2. You lift the damn phone and answer the customers. You are causing agony and anxiety by ripping apart our once in a year holiday break. 3. Our Checked in bags are gone, money did not get refunded, vacation is gone, peace of mind is gone. Shame on you Southwest Operations Team. I feel bad for their customer representatives who take all the anxiety from customers. Where is the operations head at Southwest LGA ? Face the customers, accept the fault and take appropriate measures to get the trust back !"
222,"  Southwest cancelled my flight just hours before departure and bumped me into a flight 2 days later. I was going on 5-day vacation that has just been shortened way too much. It upended all my plans and reservations. All my money and time planning lost. The worst experience ever! I understand a delay of a few hours or even a day, but more than that when the weather is actually nice makes no sense at all! Get yourself together and solve your staffing issues or stop selling flights if you can't manage to operate well enough!!"
227," |  Two years ago Southwest cancelled my flight hours before takeoff. I had the extra money in 2020 to rebook with another airline, but due to the current state of inflation, I could not afford to purchase a new flight. My flight was cancelled on 12/23/22 and I have spent over nine hours on hold trying to speak with someone. The one time a person answered, he couldn’t hear me due to the static in the line. I have not been able to reschedule so my Christmas plans along with other millions of travelers is ruined! Thanks Southwest for your poor planning. I do not want flight credits! My hard earned money needs to be returned to the card my plane ticket was purchased on. Moving forward, I’ll pay more and book with American or Delta airlines. I hope that the FAA can impose some type of substantial fine for this airline."
232," | Southwest cancelled my flight and took it upon themselves to rebook me for another flight scheduled for 3 days later. When I called to request a refund not only was I on hold for almost two hours, I was told that I could only get flight credit. Why should I only get flight credit when I paid for a flight to depart on December 23 and was not given one. Southwest stole my money! I paid for something that was not provided I should be entitled to a full refund given that I did not get what I paid for. What’s to stop Southwest from canceling every one’s flight every day and forcing them to get a credit. I don’t want a credit. I don’t want to ever fly Southwest again. I don’t need a credit. I need my money back since Southwest couldn’t deliver what I paid for. Southwest can’t keep my money. That is stealing!"
241,  I have flown faithfully with Southwest for many years and I’ve never had to cancel a flight. But my boyfriend was ill and didn’t want to expose anyone to whatever he had so we choose to cancel. When we bought our tickets it said in bold print no cancellation fee. And I looked at the small print papers and they also said no cancellation fee will be incurred. When I called to cancel the first person said there is a 200.00 dollar cancellation fee. I asked to speak to a higher person and they told me I have no choice to accept fee or lose all the money. At first I accepted it . Then I read their policy over and over and again it said no cancellation fees. I called back and spoke to someone and said this is not acceptable your policy clearly states no cancellation fees. I had to fight with this person and I told them I will see them in court and call news crews. They finally gave me back my 200.00 dollars. I still have the policy and no fees incurred on my phone. I’m disappointed that they know their policy but yet try to lie and and steal money from their clients. My boyfriend is a lawyer and I’m an educated women and had to fight for my rights. How many people have paid the fee that shouldn’t have. The airline clearly are stealing from people. The public needs to be aware of these deceptive practices. I’m sure they know what they are doing. When I called it was the same person answering and using different names. Shame on him. Shame on Southwest.
254,"  We attempted to book a flight from BWI to Indianapolis for Sunday, October 16, 2022 and wanted to use miles. We were in the process of putting in the information to purchase the ticket and got a notice that we needed to purchase additional miles. We purchased $345 in additional miles to have enough for the ticket and then continued to enter the rest of our information for the ticket. When we clicked purchase, we got an error message and it said to call the airline. Upon speaking with a Southwest Airlines representative, we were told that the flight was now sold out. So frustrating. We then asked for our money back for the miles we could no longer use and were told that they were non-refundable. Apparently Southwest thinks it's ok to spend $345 and not even get a ticket for it. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, I was told that they would forward my ""case"" to Corporate Customer Relations and that we'd hear from them in 10-12 business days. We just received a call from a Customer Relations representative and all he did was explain that he wouldn't refund the money and that it was their policy. The entire process is a bait and switch and should be banned. Southwest Airlines should stop these fraudulent practices and refund customer's money when they can't give them a ticket. We plan to avoid Southwest Airlines whenever we can. Watch out."
257," | Decided to purchase early check in hoping for a better seat. It did not clearly explain that you still have to check in later and accept the boarding assignment the choose. When questioned they rudely said ""it does not guarantee A boarding"". I asked since it will not show boarding assignments until normal 24 hours prior to flight how do I know I was give an assignment at 36 hours before flight and was very rudely told that I just didn't understand how it worked but if I wanted to spend some more money I could get an earlier boarding assignment. These are the rudest airline staff I have ever dealt with."
260," |  I have made multiple purchases for a flight and both times the money has gotten put back into my account. The first time I called them and they said it was a banking problem so I called my bank and they said it was nothing on their end, called southwest customer service again after I made my second purchase (which was $100 more then the first time I bought a ticket) and they said everything should be fine, and that the confirmation code was verified and nothing should go wrong. A couple days after wards it happened again so I just called southwest and was on hold for an entire hour just for them to tell me that I need to go to the airport and do it there, I cannot do it online or by any other card and it needs to be purchased at the airport. My flight is suppose to be in a week so there is no guarantees that seats will still be open, I have a job so I can’t go for another 3 days and my airport is almost 2 hours away from me. This is ridiculous, I’m just trying to go visit a friend in college but now I have to deal with this. I have used southwest many other times and had no problems, I thought it was reliable airline but after this, I don’t want to fly with them."
313," Atlanta to La Guardia. On Monday, July 25th, 2022, my daughter and I were returning home from Atlanta to NYC (LaGuardia) via Southwest Airlines. First time ever using them. We arrive at the airport at 4AM for a 6:10AM flight. After going through TSA and sitting at the gate for a while, our flight was cancelled with no announcement or warning. My daughter happened to look up and see on the gate TV screen the words “CANCELLED”. The gate personnel were gone and I was left to 1) calm my daughter’s nerves because she has never experienced this before 2) calm my own nerves as I suffered from severe anxiety and my meds were in my checked bag and 3) try to figure out what to do next. Keep in mind, I booked the early morning flight because I had to be home by 9:30am to take over the babysitting duties of my two other children so that my wife could go to work. So that was my first thing to address, finding last minute child care. I then get an email confirming that my flight was indeed cancelled (no explanation as to why) and I was put on the 8:25 PM plane to LGA later that night. So now the next steps were to find out what happened to our checked bags and what to do for 14 hours till my flight with pretty much no money left for my daughter and I to find a hotel (I mean we’re taking a low budget airline. I’m a stay-at-home dad living on my wife’s income. Go figure). 14 hours later with our bags in NY before we are even on a plane, we get to the departing gate for our rescheduled 8:25pm flight and of course it’s DELAYED. 9:10pm is the new departure time. Then it’s pushed back to 10PM!!! Once on the plane, only water and a snack was offered to us (soda, coffee and alcohol were no longer an option). Once at LaGuardia, we then had to find our checked bags. My pre-arranged airport pick-up, no longer available. The line for a taxi, extremely long. My daughter and I jumped on a city bus to take us to Manhattan so that we could take a taxi to the Bronx. $30 dollars I couldn’t afford to spend charged to my credit card. Long story short, got to the airport at 4AM and after an anxiety inducing day/afternoon, my daughter and I get home at 2am in the morning. Fast forward to today. I call Southwest customer service to 1) get an explanation and 2) find out how Southwest can make things right for me so that I can continue using them in the future (again, this was my first ever experience with them). The agent informed me that the first flight was canceled due to weather and that the rescheduled flight was delayed due to air traffic control issues, so we were not entitled to compensation. 1) I never once said on the call I wanted to be compensated so that was quite an assumption and 2) was then told after reiterating everything I went through “would you have preferred that we put you on an unsafe flight?” I mean WOW!!!!! What a “great” condescending customer service response. To the Southwest rep that hopefully reads this (and yes, I will be posting this on MULTIPLE review sites and social media), I shall NEVER fly Southwest again and will voice my displeasure to anyone who asks me about my experience with Southwest. PS- My family and I had an issue with JetBlue a few years ago and their customer service was the TOTAL OPPOSITE of what I experienced with Southwest. Very warm, helpful and their actions showed that I was a valued customer."
315,  Good prices and nice perk with the free checked bag. I’ve flown Southwest multiple times solely because of price and you get what you pay for. I never had a flight from Southwest on schedule. Always a delay or changing gates last minute. Seats are uncomfortable and most of the time the staff is rude. One time they “couldn’t find the pilot” and delayed us for three hours. I recommend spending the extra money and flying with another airline. Southwest is very unprofessional
320," |  Chicago to Orlando. I booked a flight for my family of 9 to depart on June 29 at 9am and when we get to the airport awaiting to be boarded, they announced the flight is canceled at 8:30am. A few minutes later, they arranged the passengers to either call or wait in line to the customer counter to have flight rearrange. The reason that was given the flight was cancelled is that weather in Orlando is bad enough for they now allowing flights to come in (which is a super stupid and big lie). And it was just that I searched the internet to see that over 1000 of their pilots are picketing and I believe this is the true reason and they just not willing to admit that and unwilling to cut low on their flights to accommodate this. Instead, my flight is delayed for almost 12 hrs and my family of 9 had to split up with 3 flying to transfer in Ohio. We ended up to arrive in Orlando at 1 in the morning instead of 1 in the afternoon. And I see that a flight on the same day departing at 10 am did not have a delay or cancellation. This is the first time I fly in Southwest and probably the last time. I accept delay but I do not accept giving unbelievable excuses due to the company’s poor management and their attitude to just want to make money and carelessness for people whatsoever."
334," |  What a scam airline. Everyone should know this scam they are pulling while bragging about no bag fees. This is there only selling point. They know they would lose 50% of their customers overnight if they started bag fees. There check in procedure is set up to make you want to use your points to upgrade. I was waiting to check in with my laptop and phone through there own app. Conveniently enough, when 24 hour check time came up, the website and app took 3 minutes to come up with the check in button. By the time it did and I was able to hit check in, I was given end of B group. I immediately called southwest to find out what was wrong with there system. The lady said nothing was wrong, BUT, we can upgrade you for 25,000 points to put you in A 1-15. I jumped on it because I want to use my points up and will never fly southwest again. Will cancel my credit card that I have had since 04 and spend extra money for peace of mind travel, not games. Very unprofessional business practices."
340," |  Currently ongoing. Typically have recommended this airline, but this has been a horrible experience. Our flight from STL to Portland, ME had our connecting flight in Baltimore canceled. Customer service was horrid and had to eat money on 2 hotel rooms for that night; the impromptu one and the originally scheduled one. Lost a full 24 hours waiting on the flight we got rebooked for. On the rebooked flight, we paid extra for A-boarding, but due to their system issue or something their personnel forgot to do in the computer with pur luggage, we got kicked out of line and had to go to customer service; nothing about us getting refunded that money. Now, flying back from Portland via Chicago to STL, showed up to airport and flight immediately delayed 2 hours. As plane touched down and getting ready to board, announced another 45 minute delay due to ""weather."" Checked weather in Chicago: beautiful. Weather here: beautiful. Weather in-between: nothing. It's all staff, but they're walking all over their customers using Weather as an excuse to keep from compensating anyone."
343," |  Southwest Airlines took $3,650.76 on May 27,2022 and refused to refund my money for a flight that they had cancel due to inclement weather on that date. That same very date of May 27,2022, Southwest had rescheduled my flight to board a 5:50am flight to Denver, Colorado to get to Houston, Texas for my family of 10 vacation and charge me a additional $3,650.76 for another flight. Southwest had dispense my older children luggage to 2 different states which was Houston, Texas and my twins stroller Denver, Colorado and my medications went to Houston, Texas as well. Southwest took a total of $7,500 in less than 48 hours and my family never flew in the airplane. Southwest took $7,500, ship our luggage to 2 different states, cancelling our flight without proper notice and called the Sherriff department to follow my family around the terminal to give us a ticket that we currently have to see a judge about now to clear our name. On top of paying $7,650.76, Southwest ask me to pay more money for my twins when I had originally paid for them to board the plane. Southwest never gave my family an apology for all of the strife, chaos, shaming, belittlement that’s that my have put on my family.  I will never have my family to board Southwest ever again. I have lost all respect for this airline company. I have encountered some rude and unprofessional workers on the customer-service lines who talks fast pace to get you off the line. Southwest promise my family a flight on 5/28/2022 blast 5:50am, they let my family board the plane as a touring experience, sit down on plane, then ask all of us to exit the plane. My personal preference will be to never paid or even board this airline again. If you want to get rip off, taking advantage of, swindle out of your hard earn money than choose this airplane as your 1st choice. After they refund my $3,650.76, I will never give them my business again. It’s way to many competitors of airlines in the world to be settling for less and making a joke out of people family members just to enjoy a family vacation that you have save for."
355, |  My review is about the customer service I have been receiving. My last two times of flying have been pretty much very dissatisfying. When I flew to Florida in June my flight got canceled I had a book at a hotel I lost a days vacation couldn’t get my money back from the hotel. Then this flight that we just came back from they change the flight so many times that when you add up the loss we took in our time vacationing we lost a whole day. Then I try to use my vouchers and my guest certificate that I got from some friends to book my Southwest vacation. And they wouldn’t take it. But I asked them to extend the six months that I had to use them and they won’t. So they took my money they stole my money. I’ve been flying with Southwest for 12 years I’m so disappointed with what they have turned into.
368, |  I called the Southwest Airlines customer service line about an issue I had when flying from Chicago to Vegas. They did not care and literally said there is nothing we can do. I get on the airplane and they say things are not working on it. Now I am on my way back from Las Vegas to Chicago and we are over 1hr late. Once again no one cares. Please read reviews before spending extra money on tickets like my business class ticket that does not mean anything.
378," |  The absolute worst airline. I wanted to give Southwest another try because a family member raves about the service. I decided to give them another try. Huge mistake. Flights not on time. Sure this airline is cheap but the value and customer service you get is suspect and chances are, your flights going to get cancelled. What happened to this airline? Pay the extra money for a different airline."
387,"  I am beyond frustrated with this airline as a concerned mother whose child is flying alone for the first time. I called the airline over 10 times and received a different story each time, to make matters even worse you can't speak to a manager or a supervisor because apparently they have none. Eventually I found out you can talk to a service coordinator. No wonder no one's on the same page and they all give you different answers! Who trained them or taught them what the airline procedures are. They don't care that you can't afford for the flight to keep going up like they said they have no control over it but neither do they have control of the procedures. I couldn't even book my child a minor under my account because they are so worried about whatever point system they have going on. They obviously need a family plan where you can have your spouse and children under. Especially for someone who gets frustrated on the internet quickly. They have made the beginning of my trip with my daughter hell and my finances tight because they had to refund me and were so happy to book another flight because apparently I'm so rich. I can't wait 3 days till the refund comes in to get another flight because I would have lost the price I could pay. So I had to come up with money for another flight which of course went up the next day but hey at least she said ""I'm Sorry""."
403," |  I missed the first leg of my flight and had to schedule 1 way. Now they canceled my return flight. I asked them how to resolve this issue and they said I needed to purchase another ticket (keeping the money from my original purchase that they canceled). Worst airline ever, worst customer service."
408,  Shame on Southwest Airlines. My husband and I and our family have used Southwest for over 20 years. This past March 12 we were supposed to leave Portland Maine at 5:30 in the morning and we received a cancellation for no reason on March 11 at 11 PM in the evening. We could not get through to the site via Internet or phone on how to reschedule a new flight. Since we had reservations for two weeks in Orlando all paid for we needed to get on a flight as soon as possible. So my husband tried and tried and waited on hold for almost an hour before he finally just gave up and decided to book a different flight and the only one we could fly find was from Boston which is a 2 Hour Drive instead of a 15 min drive to Portland. The only flight we could find was for 530 leaving Boston that morning which meant we had to leave Portland Maine by 2 AM. We did not sleep at all that night. On top of that the flight that was connecting was delayed as well. The real kicker is that because we did not follow Southwest Airlines rules for rescheduling a canceled flight we had to pay $700 more to drive two hours longer to get to the airport to actually get on a flight. And the person who answered our phone call later on was like oh well too bad you didn’t do it the way you were supposed to. I just don’t understand how a an airline can cancel the flight out of the blue for no reason and not assist their travelers. and then along the way the attendants were rude and obnoxious and in no way helpful or kind. We are still trying to figure out how we can get refunded our money over something that we did not do we did not cancel the flight Southwest airlines canceled the flight. They should honor the fact that we had booked our flights months ahead of time. And they should do a better job when canceling a flight to assist customers and getting to where they need to be.
442," I flew to Denver on December 21, 2021, with a return flight scheduled for January 3, 2022. I got caught in the biggest, most devastating fire ever in Colorado's history. My family and I were evacuated. This was a very traumatic experience and I was exposed to Covid. I tried to schedule a Covid test before the day of my flight but the earliest I could get an appointment was January 3. I bore the expense to drive home out of respect for other passengers and my inability to test due to the chaos and tragic circumstances surrounding the Marshall Fire. I received the following response today: Dear Brenda, We are sorry to learn that you were unable to travel as planned due to not feeling well, and we hope you are doing well. The reservation in question was booked at our Wanna Get Away fare, which carry restrictions such as being nonrefundable. And, while we wish we could honor every request to refund a nonrefundable fare, the reason we are able to offer these fares at such a substantial discount in the first place is because they are a firm commitment to travel. In this situation, the originally-ticketed Passenger still has the flexibility to apply these travel funds to a new reservation provided the reservation is canceled at least 10 minutes prior to travel and travel is completed by the expiration date. We are hopeful you will be able to travel with us soon. We know you have a choice when you fly, and we hope you will continue to choose Southwest. We would truly appreciate the chance to welcome you onboard soon.  I canceled out of respect for other passengers. Incidentally, I did have Covid making for a miserable drive home. I could have easily boarded that plane and saved myself a 14-hour drive on treacherous icy roads, not to mention the expense. SWA is more concerned about money than safety! I gave 24 hours notice and I guarantee my seat did not remain empty with all of the cancellations that were taking place at that time. I think SWA is despicable for putting the concern of other passengers behind the almighty dollar."
450," | First, we stood in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes before we were able to even get to the counter flying Business Select then another 15 plus minutes to get checked in as the customer service rep looked all around instead of paying attention to what he was doing. It took 5 scans of each of our passports, 2 of us were traveling together. People were moving others to the front of the business line for tips. 1 counter working A List passengers that pay more for expedition to begin with, and we were solicited to tip more to get us to the front of the line. No way! Then we were given a free drink coupon for our flight. Beer, wine or liquor was valid for the day of travel only and only for Southwest Airline, this was rejected by attendant with ""We haven't had alcoholic beverages for over two years now, then he chuckled"". A non alcoholic beverage offering at that time would have been nice, but no offer. We had already had coffee and soda, so maybe one drink allowed. This is the worst experience ever flying. Why should I pay for business class if it does not benefit me. We boarded behind wheelchair passengers and their extended families who miraculously were able to travel walking when landed due to no wheelchairs available yet at the gate. Three of 9 remained seated waiting for assistance. I have no problem waiting for those three, at all. This makes me question if I will ever fly Southwest again, but I will never pay for Business Class again with them, regular boarding took well over 2 hours to check in for the flight. There were at least 5 counters to serve other class boarding. The security process took way less time as they screened everyone's bags and persons. This is an economy type airline, thankfully it was the non-stop destination option. Beware, if you fly with them, keep your money in your pocket and don't bother with A list, business or first class, you just threw away your money."
466," |  Literally the worst airline with the worst customer service. Booked a flight for April 2020 but it was the peak of COVID pandemic and all travel had to be canceled. I was not given an option of refund, instead the money was put into my Southwest account for use within 1 year. I work in healthcare and it became nearly impossible to travel anywhere for the year. I tried to make a travel plan by December 2020 just to use the existing funds in my Southwest account but had to cancel last moment again due to increasing COVID cases around December 2020. Again the amount was put back into my Southwest account until it expired and now they’re are offering me a small voucher after all my flight money has been taken. I am so disgusted by the way they handled the refunds during the pandemic. I vow to never board Southwest ever again!"
469," |  Spoke with a reservation agent regarding booking a military flight for four round trip tickets on Dec 12 for Dec 24.-Jan 3.. Was told that paris would not need a seat so we proceeded to talk about purchasing three seats and were asked for our card details so it can be placed on file. After giving our details the gentleman made the purchase without any consent of the purchase being made at that moment or anything. My husband had to look at our account to see that money had been taken after asking the gentleman why would he not notify us he then proceeds to say that he never really took our son into account(put him in the system) and now he need to make a separate purchase because he infants does need a seat and that any 2 and up has to pay for a seat, although in a previous conversation he had said 2 and under. Not once did he apologize for charging our card without approval nor for neglecting to tell us our child did need a seat at the time of purchase when being told originally that he didn’t. We are in the holiday season when tickets can be pricey and I feel that we should’ve been given a option as to which airline would accommodate us better instead our money was taken and now we have to week 7-10 business days to get the money back and by then all the airline seats will be sold out or higher due to this inconvenience. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was switched to a department without briefing them of my case and without any notations being place on my account. And the Supervisor didn’t help either it was either get a refund or pay full price for my sons ticket(a seat that he will not sit in) no discount, no taxes dropped for making me have to do two purchases when being asked if 4 tickets needed to be purchased and/or no comped seat for the child. Completely unprofessional experience and I never intend to fly with this company again. There’s no respect for the customers and they don’t believe in satisfying the customers even when the customers are looking for a resolve."
477," |  We flew Southwest for family vacation to Cancun. We went from GR to Chicago and when boarding started they said first come first serve on seats and we were letter C so we're last to board. Some of us got to sit together to Chicago, once we boarded in Chicago to Cancun again first come first serve we were letter C again . My family was strong put through out the whole airplane . My son has a brain injury and didn't have a clue how to fill out the declaration papers. So you people need to start assigning seats. We all ended up in middle seats and were like sardines  .. for the money we paid should of got better service. No one wants to move or offer a seat because they want an empty seat between them. With my experience I doubt I will fly Southwest again. "
504," |  Terrible business model, if you reserve a flight six months in advance then cancel within a week you cannot get a refund, you are instead offered a credit which can be used to purchase another flight through Southwest Airlines, but only within the next 12 months. You are required to pay a higher price for a ticket to get a refund just in case you need to cancel the flight to actually get your money back. "
511," | I purchased my ticket the night before my flight (San Diego to Phoenix). After all the cancellations I felt this was a bad idea, but it’s a 1 hour flight. What could go wrong? Multiple delays. Insane. Southwest wants to keep pocketing money and cancelling flights. Total joke. Will never fly with these clowns again. Thanks for allowing me to be late for my sisters wedding, Southwest. Especially when I could have just made the 5hr drive."
519,  Never ever flying Southwest again. They cancelled our flight last minute and we were told they can’t fly us home until two days later. When we asked for a hotel they said “all of our hotels are booked.” I demanded to speak with the manager who took 30 mins to come talk to us and acted like it was a big deal to get us a hotel. This airline refused to give us a credit to fly home today through another airline. We asked if they could fly us to somewhere near our home and they simply said “we don’t have anything.” Worst experience and ruined our vacation. Not only did we have to call off of work but we had to spend extra money for food and ubers.
539," |  I flew with my 11 year old who is on the spectrum takes ADHD medicine and has anxiety! When a gate attendant allowed us to pre-board, another one, right at the time of entry said we shouldn't be pre-boarding and kind of implied that we are abusing the pre-boarding option! Second time from Seattle to Nashville I bought 3 premium tickets and was among the first 5 to board, then I was told that I am carrying more luggage on myself and should consolidate between my son, my mother, who has shoulder pain! What's the point of paying premium money when you have to take their hassle."
568,"  My family and I bought Southwest tickets to fly to Mexico in December for my 50th birthday. Prior to flying my father contracted COVID and was also diagnosed with dementia. The hotels also put COVID restrictions into place. We called Southwest and cancelled our flights to which we were given ""Travel Funds"". Fast forward we are taking the family and going on a vacation in December, this year. We tried to book the flights using our travel funds and were told we can not due to them expiring in October. We called customer service and explained the situation and were rudely told we have to wait until they expire and then pay a $100/per ticket fee to reinstate them. We understand paying the fee and requested to pay it now to extend the date. We explained we can not wait until October to book the flights as flights are limited and are already nearly sold out. The customer service rep had zero compassion and stated there was nothing she could do that that was the policy. We asked to speak to a supervisor and were told only contact with them was through email. The email response we received only had a first name and stated there was absolutely nothing that could be done to try and resolve the problem. We called customer service again and once again explained the situation. We again said we would gladly pay the fee now and book the flights. The rep sternly responded that they are not able or willing to do anything to assist. That we would have to take our chances and wait until after October (IF they decide to take the fee and extend the funds!) or just lose all the money. They stated they gave 2 year extensions for travel plans changed due to covid, she then sarcastically stated that we did not fall in that time frame. COVID is out of our control, along with the medical problems of my father. We are not asking for a refund of the money or even asking to have a fee waived to extend the funds. I simply want to book a flight flying the same month I was going to previously! No compassion and no attempt at finding a solution!!! I will not fly Southwest again."
580,"  Please save your money and time flying with this Airline. We paid for nonstop flight for 2 ways, then 2 hrs before departure flight we received a text message stated that our flight was delay (we live 1 and a half hour away from the Airport). So they changed our flight from nonstop to transfer for the next day and when we checked the return flight, they also changed it from nonstop to transfer flight. Therefore, we called back to customer relation and customer reservation department on July 15th to talk to one person name Ro and one person name Martin - no one could help us out or gave us any compensation or rebook the straight flight for us. They gave me a really shit show on the phone (also they don’t have the manager or higher position they could transfer me to find the solution lol). I hope the management level can read this review. "
581,"  What happened to Southwest? I’ve been flying with them for 20+ years. They use to be a good airline then we just flew with them. I know COVID was tough on airlines but they were subsidized to stay open by us taxpayers, now that restrictions are lifted they sandbag flights till they can pack them out and if there are a few empty seats there are always stand by. The flight attendants and pilots all seemed unhappy. Every aspect of the experience was like they cut as many corners and saved as much money as they could yet charge extreme prices for tickets. But somehow they just invested a ton of money on all of these new Supermax planes that have safety concerns. Looking for a new airline to fly from now on even though I have a ton of points. I would rather throw them away than fly with them again."
595," |  No Customer Service. Flight was cancelled via text message 2 hours prior to departure. Could not get a Rep on the phone after holding 2 hours. Im on hold again now hold time 2+ hours and counting. I had to spend extra money that I did not have on hotel, food, and transportation with no verbal assistance at ALL. I was told I could email them with hopes of a response time of weeks! Not Days but weeks. This is just not acceptable. NO one that works for this airlines care about its passengers. After they get your money, that's it. Hope you get to your destination. Take your money elsewhere."
610," | Southwest is the welfare of airlines! I will never forget the ridiculous night that I had sitting in Baltimore Airport after being delayed for at least 4 different reasons and even boarded on the plane and driven around the tarmac and then after several hours and different excuses, told to get off the plane because the pilot had timed out and the flight is canceled! I sat alone all night in the airport and it should never have happened! Then they offer to fly me home 2 days later? No money and sleep at the airport? The best part is I have been trying to call them for a week and automated says 1 hour wait on hold, so I waited and they picked up and hung up, not one time but 3 times! I will pay more for one of the more reliable airlines. Check Southwest reviews, all similar accounts."
615," | First, we boarded the plane late due to a maintenance issue. Then, we sat on the tarmac for an hour before the crew announced they couldn’t fix the issue so we’d have to exit the plane, luggage and all. We were told to just wait for an update. The plane didn’t leave until 5 hours after the original departure date. Due to the delay we missed our connecting flight. Southwest booked us for an evening flight, forcing us to stay another 5 hours in another airport terminal. (They wouldn’t put us on an earlier flight.) We are arriving so late that we are missing our last train home and will have to book a hotel. In sum, we were supposed to arrive at our destination at 11.30am, and will now be arriving at 10pm. Next time, I will pay extra money for a more reliable airline, because the 10.5 hours wasted and hotel add up to more than what a pricier ticket would have been."
616," |  To say my last experience with Southwest was a disaster would be an understatement! It all started from day one to the very end. Beyond disappointed! To start, my flight to Long Island was supposed to be Friday at 5.45 am out of San Antonio, TX. I made sure to check in exactly 24 hours prior, as I always have, and got my confirmation and boarding pass. Then, that very same night, the day before I'm supposed to leave, I get an email from Southwest saying my flight has been changed to the following day, more than 24 hours later than my flight, due to a disruption in my itinerary? So, while I'm panicking because I needed to be in Long Island by Friday, not Saturday, I decided I was going to just show up and play dumb! So, I did! Once I arrived there, I had to talk with the customer service team due to receiving an error at the ticketing kiosk (because they changed my flight, of course). I was asked ""Umm...did you change your flight?!"" Yes, yes I did and just decided to show up a day prior! Not! So, I very politely said, ""No, I had not."" They accommodated thank goodness but, I had to fly out an hour later than expected. Okay, whatever, fine. Then comes the following Tuesday. I had this feeling in the pit of my stomach just knowing something bad was going to happen. First off, my flight from Long Island to Orlando got delayed two hours due to ""computers going down and there being nothing they can do"". Once I got on the plane, they then had us sit on the plane for 30-45 minutes because ""the plane is too heavy and they were trying to figure out numbers"". Okay, great. Now I'm starting to panic. Not to mention, while all of these delays are happening, I'm terrified I'm going to miss my other flights. I was originally supposed to be home at approximately 6pm but, due to all of the changes and issues, I got home close to 1am the next day! Another flight told us that ""they didn't have any flight attendants for the flight"" and it, too, got delayed another few hours. Just beyond livid with the way everything was handled! And, not to mention, since I got back to the San Antonio airport the next day (at 1am), I got charged $20 more for parking my car there an extra day. I just do not recommend using them going forward! They do not have anything in order and everything was in complete disarray. I will be using United or Delta going forward because, even as one of the flight attendants said to a plane full of upset people, and I quote, ""at least they (United Airlines and Delta won't be late for your flights"". So, not only was an entire day wasted for me with frustration and disappointment, I also am out more money than I anticipated because of how much later my flight was. Run! Do not use Southwest Airlines!"
625," |  This airline cost me a lot of money by causing me to miss my international flight. Their system was down for many hours so we missed our flight to Iceland and had to stay overnight in Seattle. Not only they did not address our issues, but many of their personnel were also rude. What kind of airline is not able to fix their computer system on time in Silicon Valley? The answer is Southwest. They caused many passengers who were traveling from Southern Ca sit in the airplane for 7 hours or more to get to the destination in Seattle. You get what you pay for. Cheap airline and incompetent personnel. If I could give negative stars, they would get -5. We could not even use the internet on the flight and had no hot beverage (could only offer soda or room temperature water)."
632,"  I raced to my connecting flight at Atlanta airport. My seat was sold to another, because I arrived on time. I was told it was my fault that my seat was sold to another leaving me embarrassed, spending more money to re-schedule my hotel and car rental, and then criticized in front of strangers for being late/on time to my flight. My name nor flight was never released on the overhead speakers. My experience that I will share with my family, friends, and most importantly the colleagues from my office advising me not to fly Southwest - money is the only thing Southwest acknowledges or cares about. Southwest's name makes me sick to my core. Only more money from customers who missed their flights, or will pay additional funds to take someones seat is more important than a paying customer. A supervisor came out to speak to my husband and I about the Southwest attendant speaking rude to us to another couple. The supervisor blamed me for being on time to my flight giving Southwest permission to give my seat away making it okay for the attendant to speak about me to this other couple. The reasoning for allowing the rudeness is because I was on time to my flight therefore making any rude comments from a staff member acceptable. I am in my mid-30's and will ensure I never fly Southwest or speak kindly of the company. The company only cares about money and not the future. Keep my well earned money, because it's too little to amount to the future wealth you could have had. My word of mouth will forever be negative towards this airline and staff for being rude and inconsiderate to a person paying for their service. I regret not cancelling my flight with Southwest after several colleagues suggested I change airlines. It was my waste of money to give Southwest a chance."
635," | Will never fly with this airline again. Didn’t know they had “open seating,” which means that people walk on and sit wherever they please. Which is great for the people with money who can afford to upgrade to the first seating class. Not great for single parents or other families who can’t, because of you are in group C to board, you are almost guaranteed to be separated from your kids/rest of your family. As a single parent, I was furious that my kids and I were scattered throughout the plane and forced to sit next to strangers instead of as a family. The reason I was given was “they haven’t assigned seating in 50 years.” So, that makes it right? No. It doesn’t. We didn’t even get cabin service on the flights and everyone is crammed together like sardines. Lowered the tray tables so I could use it for other things and it was filthy - had crumbs and all, clearly wasn’t cleaned. Absolutely awful experience. Will fly any other airline but theirs."
647," | I have only flown twice in my whole life. My first experience was with Delta Air Lines and it was amazing. My second experience flying with Southwest Airlines was absolutely horrible. Seating is at a first come first serve basis. Therefore if you check in super early you are guaranteed better seating? Well I checked into my returning flight about 16-18 hours before my flight and was still put in the C category, meaning that your one of the last groups of people to board. Not wanting to be the last group to board me and my fiancé paid $40 per person, a total of $80 to get a boarding pass in the A group. A7 and A8. Pittsburgh was to board at gate C9. While sitting there waiting to board our plane an announcement was made that all of the sudden Pittsburgh was to board at gate C11. So everyone on that flight ran over to gate C11. When we got there to board about 140 passengers were already on the flight and the guy boarding the plane said ""oh you probably won’t get to sit together since there’s so many passengers on already"". We said ""ok well we paid $80 for us to be in group A so we could sit together."" In return he said ""I made the announcement a few times in 2 hours."" Ok well if that were in fact true then everyone else would have heard him as well. I’m completely dissatisfied and disappointed with this airline. I will never use them to fly again. Your better off going somewhere elsewhere where they have assigned seating and can help you out, not ruin your whole trip. We should get reimbursed for the extra money spent since we paid and did not get what we had paid for. After landing in Pittsburgh at our destination we approached the attendant asking what we could do to get our money back for our upgraded seats and her response was, “The tickets are non refundable sorry.” So we then asked if there’s someone we can call about the issue and she said, “You can call but you still won’t get your money back.” Seriously after paying over a thousand dollars for the flights already then another $80 on top of that for upgraded seats is just ridiculous. It’s highly disappointing and I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone."
665," |  I am a flyer on Southwest. Perhaps not as much as most people, but a number of flights per year. I have a Southwest Rapid Rewards number. I was flying to Portland from Ontario, CA, with a stop in Sacramento. I was going to see my Mother in Salem, her health had deteriorated rapidly after falling and breaking her hip. She was sent home under hospice care with as little as a week to live. I was determined to see her. We landed in Sacramento which showed a 4 hour layover. I didn't want to delay and needed to get to Salem. I checked Alaska and they had a flight that would arrive 2 hours earlier. I booked the flight and flew Portland. After arriving in Portland drove to Salem to see my Mother. That afternoon I received an email from Southwest informing me that the rest of my itinerary had been canceled and all payments forfeited. I called and the support person said because I didn't cancel the flight, and didn't inform them, that my return trip was canceled and money forfeited. I guess I forgot to read the fine print. Because of this policy, even though I felt it more important to get to my Mother's side, I now didn't have a return flight. I used to fly Southwest. But with that uncaring, insensitive response to stand by their rules. I am no longer a Southwest flyer. I will tell everyone I can my story, and encourage them NOT to fly Southwest. "
680," |  This airline fails to meet domestic standards when it comes to safely handling passengers' suitcases during transportation. They will offer an unlimited number of suitcases for you to check in, charge you exorbitant amounts of money for it, but then damage your suitcases and belongings and loose part of it. They would apologize at your arrival and offer you very bad quality ""emergency bags"" to contain the rest of your belongings so you can take it home, and some 2 cents voucher and keep your damaged property promising you that the airline will cover its cost if you go on some specific online platform that is difficult tp access with codes and other information and send them your ticket information, pictures and tags - but once you follow all of their nonsense various requests and even provide them with photos and receipts, they will call you a liar, deny responsibility and basically just tell you: ""go ahead, sue me"". Complete unprofessionalism and abuse of power and totally unethical ways of treating passengers. They damaged and lost part of my belongings and it has been a month that they have been playing games and sending nonsense conflicting letters where they are basically insulting the passenger and demanding completely unrelated things. They are offering free 2 first suitcases for a reason!!"
686,"  Southwest Airlines took my money for a flight to Costa Rica, then Southwest stopped flying there and they won't refund my money. They told me I could reschedule but had to fly within a year. They still haven't started flying there and they told me I will just lose my 1,050.00. They blamed it on Costa Rica, but that is a lie since other US Airlines are flying there. Southwest Airlines just flat out stole over a thousand dollars from me. Whatever you do, do not book with Southwest Airlines. They are literally high-class thieves."
692,"  On January 3rd 2021, I arrived to ORF with 2 checked bags, a book bag personal item, and early bird seating. We were off to Nashville around 1500 with dense fog noted. Soon (10 minutes?) after takeoff, it seemed like we were not ascending as usual. The cabin became unusually hot and there was an awful plastic/metal smell with some vibrations that I thought was just turbulence. The captain came overhead to inform us we had struck a flock of birds and we were returning to Norfolk to service the engine. The next 20 minutes were terrifying as we glided back down to safety and I applaud the flight crew for returning us safely...however the next few events following this incident is where I have some issues with southwest. I have always enjoyed flying with southwest airlines and I am an easy customer to please. I frequently travel and understand that there are some circumstances that flight crews and airport personnel can not control. However, I found the way that Southwest dealt with the situation was despicable and disrespectful. A simple phone-call to follow-up after a terrifying incident would have sufficed. However, I want to acknowledge how great the employees were at the gate dealing with the rescheduling issue and the flight crew (unless they failed to report it...). We all exited the plane and were asked to wait in the terminal. Everyone was confused and no one was sharing information and there was only 1 person to help direct all 180 of us on what to do next...(she was awesome, thus the 5 star ground rating). The flight was canceled and I was pleased that SW attempted to reschedule me to get to my final destination to MKE (Nashville was my connection). I ended up asking to change the one they rescheduled (Orf to orlando to MKE) and flew directly to Chicago and drove up to Mke from there. So...never heard word from southwest about the incident, do I get money back? I know that direct to Chicago was cheaper. And I didn't get my early bird status. I checked the FAA bird strike database, not even reported...I hope they actually inspected/serviced that airbus. The next day I was happy because I called and asked where my checked bags were and the very helpful lady informed me that she would make sure they made it to MKE from Nashville (I'm glad those people who waited for that rescheduled flight got to go!) and SW called me when my bags were ready to be picked up.But all in all, I am super salty that our plane hit birds and had to turn around and was not once addressed by the airline. No ""We are sorry you experienced that"", no flight coupon for my early bird. I mean if I wanted to be treated that way they should at least make us sign a safety waiver?"
700," | At the point of boarding the plane, I was verbally accosted by the gate agent who rudely embarrassed me by loudly stating I had too many carry on items to board the plane and that I needed to ""go over there and check something."" I politely tried to tell the woman that I had a bag with food for the flight and a fleece jacket in it. Didn't matter. I was accused of having a fanny pack when I was wearing a waist belt in lieu of carrying a purse. I had a mini backpack with chargers that per Southwest, are not supposed to be checked in baggage and a small suitcase. I was not given an opportunity to combine anything. I do not consider a waist belt, which I was wearing and is similar to a money belt or passport belt, to be a carry on item. It takes up no more space on my body than a belt on my pants. I never remove the waist belt and it does not impede sitting in a single seat or fastening my seatbelt. I do not consider food that I was going to eat in flight, especially as I was taking an antibiotic at that time for a GI condition, to be a carry on item. There were many, many other passengers who were carrying food on the plane in addition to other carry on items. I have never heard of a coat/jacket being considered as a carry on item. When I left Phoenix it was almost 90 degrees. When I arrived in Detroit 4 hours later, the temperature was about 45. To say a jacket/coat was necessary is an understatement. The gate agent was incredibly and unnecessarily rude. I was embarrassed unnecessarily in front of other passengers waiting to board. I have GI issues and cannot eat anything that might have been served in flight. Taking my own food on a 4 hour flight did not seem unreasonable. The mini backpack I had is about the size of an ordinary shoe box. Had I been given the chance, I would have combined items (except the waist belt) but I was denied that opportunity. I submitted a complaint to Southwest post-flight and received an email that in essence, blamed me for having so many carry on items, quoted a number of Southwest policies on baggage as if I do not know how to read and more importantly, failed to provide what I consider to be a sincere apology or any language about the gate agent receiving any kind of coaching, reprimand or training to correct her inappropriate behavior. In other words, it was all my fault. I am not ok with that. I have flown Southwest many times in the past and never had this kind of experience. I hope to never fly Southwest again. Public humiliation is uncalled for, period. Not being given a chance to ""fix"" my ""mistake"" and being ordered around rudely and loudly like a bad child is uncalled for. And to make matters worse, after we boarded the plane, we then sat in line with 24 planes ahead of us and took off 30 minutes late. Wow."
707,"  I booked my flight in October of 2020 to go and visit my 74 year old mother in Las Vegas. At the time, they stated nobody would be sitting in the middle seats, and now they send me an email stating that they are going to sell the middle seats. The alternative they are giving is to get your money back, really? I guess I don't want to see my mom over the holidays. I have never done anything but boasted on how good an airline Southwest is, but this is ridiculous! They do not care about the safety of their passengers or their employees! Horrible service!"
733, Like many others I had to make changes in my plans due to Covid. Southwest only offered a voucher for future flights. No where on there website do they post refund policies involving the Early bird check in option. The problem is the voucher they offer for my early bird check in expires prior to the flight voucher. Somehow this makes sense to them. I hate this airline and will avoid using it in the future. They must need the money more then me. 
740,"  I have a Southwest travel fund for $167 that expires Sept. 17, 2020. I had planned to use it this Spring, until national restrictions due to Covid-19 prevented my travel. In May, a Southwest travel rep reassured me the travel fund expiration date was extended to Dec. 17, 2020. I was SO relieved because $167 is a good amount of money I didn't want to lose, and I couldn't travel again any earlier than October 2020. But when I tried to book my flight (in June), I got an error message that said my travel fund expiration date was Sept. 17, 2020. I immediately called Southwest customer service to explain that I was told the wrong expiration date by one of their reps and due to Covid-19 health concerns and regional restrictions, I can't use my travel credit until October 2020. FUN FACT: Did you know... Southwest is extending the expiration date for travel funds that expire between March 1 and Sept. 7, 2020, to now expire Sept. 7, 2022? That now gives travelers 2 YEARS to use their travel credit. I have to assume they've done this to protect the health of those Southwest fliers who don't feel safe flying any time soon and in the midst of Covid-19. What a nice, and very practical, gesture! Let me remind you my travel fund expiration date is Sept. 17, 2020. And because it falls 10 days later, my own health and safety is NOT prioritized by Southwest travel policy-makers. Instead, I'm forced to use my $167 travel fund by Sept 17, 2020 and risk not only my own health, but that of my friends, family and fellow fliers -- or it disappears forever. I spoke with several reps (including a customer relations manager) and none of them gave a damn that I couldn't use my travel fund, when I was initially told by one of their reps that it expired on Dec. 17, 2020. That doesn't sound like transparency to me!"
747," |  Incredibly disappointed in a company I’ve trusted for so many years. A company known for outstanding customer service. Southwest Airlines not only cancelled my late July flight with no notice, when I log into my account to book another flight is when I see I have no upcoming trips so I call customer service only to be told sorry it’s out of our control we can issue you a refund within 30 days. It certainly didn’t take them 30 days to collect my money when I trusted them to book a flight with them. Unfortunately they have permanently lost a customer, not acceptable Southwest Airlines."
761," Chicago to Orlando. Southwest Airlines we were supposed to go to Florida March 17-March 24, obviously with a two-year-old with asthma who sees a pulmonologist for it every 3 months, a 6-month-old-baby and someone who is 69 and people with underlying conditions, we, unfortunately, had to make the choice to stay home during all of this. They will not refund our flights because we booked as a “group” we still paid $260 a flight and the best they will offer is new flights to go by May 30 - in the middle of a pandemic. They care more about money than the safety of humans. Seriously disgraceful - at least 5 of us have called them and got the same response that “you can email them but they don’t know if they will refund you” (my sister just got the email response that they will not). Our kids are already having a hard time with us having to cancel, disgraceful. I will never book Southwest again and before you do remember this, please."
766,"  Chicago Midway to Denver. Adding my disappointment in what has been known as the airlines that have the best customer service and ""caring"" for their customers. I would expect them to take the lead on understanding and how they can help customers in these scary and challenging times. I also had an event canceled due to Coronavirus and it will not be rescheduled. So I will not be refunded. Or I can use this money for a year for something else, I guess I just pick a place to go to use the money, then also will have hotel and food fees, etc? we are not a family that can afford to just go somewhere to use this. Maybe something will come up that we have to go to in a year, who knows. But this has changed totally how I feel about Southwest Airlines and I will not choose them in the future.  American airlines refunded my friend for a cancellation due to Coronavirus. Wrong move Southwest, wrong move."
770,"  Fort Lauderdale to San Antonio. As we all know things have become a lot more difficult these past few weeks. We are living in a global crisis. But. Southwest Airlines could care less so long as they get paid. Trying to cancel a flight that was booked before everything shut down. Before the threat of disease. And I’m told I can’t get my money back? This isn’t a regular circumstance. We are dealing with a global pandemic. But again. Nobody matters more than the almighty dollar. Nothing matters more than keeping those pockets lined does it? And people wonder why nobody has any faith in American consumerism. This is why. Because the only thing that matters is money. I will never do business with your institution again. . At the end of the day, you guys can keep your measly $500. Add that to the money you’ll get when you receive your bailout money from the government. You know, the money you “need” because we’re facing a global crisis. Imagine that. Quick to receive something because of extenuating circumstances but just as quick to hold fast to their “policy” when they have to do their part. Ah yes. Corporate America has never been brighter. Two words. Never. Again."
776,"  Milwaukee to Seattle. We had to cancel and rebook our up coming flight due to the corona virus. We were able to rebook the flight for a future date but they refuse to transfer the early bird check in to the new flight. We paid for a service they never provided and now they will not honor the $200.00 we paid for this service. To be clear we didn't even want a refund just transfer the service to the new flight. This is sad as Southwest used to be my favorite airline. I would strongly recommend not spending the money on early bird check in, it is a scam."
778,"  Tulsa to Las Vegas. Due the current Coronavirus pandemic and state of emergency, Southwest is not refunding money or extending their cancellation policy. My Upcoming business conference has been canceled due to the Coronavirus pandemic and due to circumstances beyond my control, and I need to cancel my flight."
783," |  Please be cautious when you are purchasing Wanna Get Away airline tickets right now. I had purchased two tickets for some friends to come visit me in Philadelphia on my Southwest Credit Card. We were planning on going to New York; however, due to the coronavirus, they are afraid to come now and rightfully so. I purchased the tickets under my name and I was told by Southwest Airlines that I am not able to transfer those tickets to my name with no exception, so I am losing $976.92 because this was their only opportunity to come visit me and they cannot come at a later date. These tickets are non refundable and non transferrable so be aware. With everything that is going on right now, it is probably best not to purchase these tickets right now. You will lose your money if you have to cancel."
819,"  I will never fly with Southwest Airlines again. Our trip was flat out cancelled in March when all of the 737 debacle happened. Not their fault. They kindly gave us an $800 flight credit to use in the next year. We saved it so that we could go and see family over the holidays. I booked it 6 weeks ago, so I could get the times I wanted. Got 2 text messages this morning delaying the flight to Dallas so that we missed our connection to Amarillo. Had to re-book and now we lost a day of time with my family. We had to get a hotel room in Amarillo because we are getting in so late and had to delay our car rental. The customer service lady was extremely rude and really couldn't care less. Oh and to add to it - I refreshed the flight information on the Southwest website. The flight time was changed back to a good time where we could have made the connection, but by the time I called they had already sold all of the seats. I guess we should have risked it and just gone to the airport hoping that something would work out. Southwest offered nothing, not even an apology for the missed time and extra money we had to spend."
837," |  In mid September, my husband and I took a short flight from Oakland to Portland, as we were moving up to our new place in Portland. I packed my wedding flatware, which I use for special occasions in my check in luggage, thinking that if I added it to my carry on, they could consider it to be dangerous. Up to this point, the other issue I had with Southwest over luggage was a few years ago when they smashed up my Samsonite luggage from OAK to Long Beach. They did correct the situation by reimbursing me for the damage. However, when I arrived at PDX and our new place, I did not unpack all of my luggage immediately, since we had 4 bags between the two of us. A few days after we landed, I looked for my flatware and found it was missing, except for the butter knives. Someone took out the 12 dinner forks, 12 salad forks, 12 Soup spoons and 12 teaspoons, I called Southwest right away and was told that they would process the claim. When I called customer service, I begged and pleaded for them to find it and return it to me. I don't even want the money for the flatware, I just wanted the flatware because it was sentimental to me. SouthWest said someone could have taken it out of my luggage and not returned it to its place and that many times it ends up at a lost and found in Atlanta. Well, I put in a claim, sent a letter and asked them to check in Atlanta. ALL I wanted was my flatware. it wasn't extremely expensive, but it was Mikasa and it had been discontinued. They denied my claim and when I appealed the denial, they sent me a letter stating that they cannot reimburse everyone for what they ""claim"" they lost and hoped that I would not give them bad online reviews because of it."
872,"  Indianapolis to New Orleans. I have been a big supporter of Southwest in the past. I would drive the 2 hours instead of using the local airport, because of cost savings and a good flight. I flew in March with no issues, but this September was a different story. My flight to MSY was okay, but the return trip was another story. My flight was cancelled. I did get another flight to a city that was two hours from my destination. I had to drive to the other airport to pick up my car. Southwest lost my luggage and i had to wait several days for it to be delivered to my home. I incurred extra cost to get back to the other airport at such a late hour, and lost money by not getting back home at designated time. I called Southwest to ask about reimbursement for at least my hotel and rental car that was extra, but was told we do not cover those expenses. I have another flight next month, and I decided to just fly from the smaller local airport. My expenses are a bit more, but my time has value as well, and with what happened last time, the flight was not cheaper in the end. Southwest did not provide value and I see no longer to fly with them."
909,  Indianapolis to Denver. I spent a lot of money on 6 tickets to fly to Denver for my brothers wedding. When we checked our bags in the lady at the counter told us we could board as family due to having 2 of my 4 kids under the age of 6. When it came time time board with family boarding the lady at the gate was trying to make my older boys ages 11 and 13 wait and board at the end with c class! She said only the parents and the children under the age of 6 could board as family. I spent more money on those tickets than probably anyone on that flight! I told the lady at the gate that I was told we could all board as family and she said no! For fear of being kicked off the flight I myself waited with my older boys and boarded last and we were all split up all over the plane and I couldn't get a seat close to my husband to help with the younger kids! 
910," |  Absolutely ridiculous customer service. Don’t fly Southwest Airlines. Remember, you get what you pay for. If there are any issues that would require customer service assistance from this airline your done for. The nightmare initially begun on the 17th of July when I was scheduled to depart from St. Louis to arrive in Norfolk, VA. Arrive at the Southwest ticketing counter to learn my flight had been cancelled due to weather. Once I learned this, I asked the ticketing agent isn’t it protocol for someone to call, text, or email me the customer, to make them aware of the flight changes. The reply I got was priceless. Basically, my question was ignored. So, now the ticketing agent begins to look in order to rebook my flight. Now, they book me a flight for the very next morning. However, this time I will have to fly from St Louis to Cleveland, OH, then to Chicago, Illinois and then onto a Norfolk. Of course, I accept the reservation thinking all has been resolved and there would be no more issues. So approximately hours later I arrive back in St. Louis airport. I board the first flight from St. Louis thinking I’m finally on my way to my destination and I would be good to go. The plane lands arriving in Cleveland with the pilot coming on the speaker stating, “there’s a weather delay and no one can get in or out of Chicago”!  After sitting in Cleveland for almost four hours until finally being cleared for take off to continue the journey now to Chicago and then Norfolk. Finally, land in Chicago approximately three hours after my Southwest connection flight had already departed for Norfolk. I immediately go to Southwest customer service counter to explain what I just went through. First, I’m told all remaining flights are booked going to Norfolk. I’m also told that they can fly me to Baltimore, Maryland the next day, which would be the third day! And I’m also told when I get to Baltimore I would have to be on standby in order to try to get a flight to Norfolk. Now, my frustration is beginning to show. I ask if I would be provided a hotel here in Chicago and I was told no. So, I get no hotel, no later flight, and absolutely nothing at all in order to make up for this inconvenience. Not even a bag of peanuts or even a drink. I always knew this was a suspect airline. However, take it from me. Save your money and go United or Delta. If you don’t and something happens. In my case weather!!! Then, your just throwing your money away. I understand weather is not the airlines fault. However, it’s how the customer service takes care of their customers during that inconvenience is what is being measured. I’m a customer who definitely learns from their mistakes. In short, no one should have to experience this, especially in a strange unfamiliar city and then get told that the best they can do is have me sleep on the floor in the airport and then ride to another strange city to then be placed on standby for the final destination"
927,"  I regretfully feel obligated to report my experience this previous weekend 6/22 regarding Southwest Airlines and their Southwest Vacations. I have been a loyal supporter of Southwest for over 15 years, and have had nothing but superior customer service and great experiences until this unfortunate event. I went to Southwest as I always do and decided to use their Southwest Vacations options since I was staying at a hotel this trip. Everything was fine, or so I thought, untill 6/22 my scheduled departure date. I go online to check in to my flight only to find out that my flight has been cancelled without notification to me. Surprised I call Southwest and try to understand what has happened. After about 2 hours on hold I was told that my flight was cancelled due to weather and that I had unknowingly booked through a 3rd party and not Southwest themselves, despite using the Southwest official website to book. After a 20 minute conversation I was forced to leave the following day as there were no flights remaining that day (unless I could get to the gate within 10 minutes), causing me to miss previously scheduled and paid for events that could not be made up or refunded. I then call the hotel and try to cancel my room since I will not be staying there and they said that since I booked though Southwest Vacations, they had to cancel the room and refund me. Did not seem like an issue. Fast forward to today, 6/27. I finally am back and get to speak with customer relations from Southwest. Thinking that this should not be much of an issue as they had miscommunication on their end, they could refund me for the nights stay that I would miss as they called and cancelled the night with the hotel, and would be able to compensate me in some manor for the error of not contacting me to allow me to get on a different flight earlier that day that had availability, and some possible compensation for the events that were missed. During the conversation with the agent for Southwest, she specifically said that ""They would take responibility"" for the error as Southwest Vacations is subcontracted though a 3rd party administrator. Even though it bears the offical Southwest logo, is accessed though their Official website, they contract out that to another party, but she still stated ""they would (were taking) take responsibility"" I think, great we can get this taken care of, to only have Southwest offer me a $50 voucher. $50 to cover 3 missed events, a premium room on Saturday night in Las Vegas, and a lost day of my vacation. This is 100% unacceptable as they themselves took responsibility for the error and still refused to at the very least refund me the money for the hotel room that was never used and some gesture for the error. I can not believe that Southwest who allows their logo and namesake to be used to mislead loyal customers into using something that they promote on their website, but then do not stand behind even though it holds their name is despicable. I felt disrespected as a loyal customer to be offered $50 for what was a loss of 20 times that amount. Southwest, if you are going to license out your name to a separate company, back them and have a system in place to contact clients, or do not promote them on your official website to defraud your loyal customers."
929," |  El Paso to Oklahoma via Dallas. What happened to all those employees who help in time of need? There were kids on the ground exhausted, people in distress by the boat load. You guys are so quick to tell good stories and how your employees help. They all went home to bed, the few that were there I could tell were bothered by the chaos and had no answers for anyone. There was one employee walking down the long line of people. I thought finally someone to help give us an update. No she was just trying to figure out why so many hundreds of people were in line at such a late hour. I guess if I didn’t start recruiting people at midnight to help find a taxi, UBER or Lyft to Oklahoma I would have slept on the floor and I think your staff would have left thinking that seems wild. It felt like we were treated just like that a wild animal who didn’t belong in the airport. Left @ 12:30pm from El Paso Texas Flight delayed while on plane 655pm due to fuel gauge?  The ramp got stuck and there was an electrical problem. Still stuck on the plane. Pilot in disbelief and apologies We wait back in the boarding area only to be told the flight is canceled, hundreds of people get in line. All the staff looked panicked with no words of comfort to a lot of sleepy, tired angry people. We wait for hours to be told no flights till Tuesday, no vouchers for hotel, no rental cars available, too late to rent by midnight. 1am looking for a place to sleep. Decide to start asking Uber and Lyft after 5 drivers refusing to drive that far. I tried to go back into airport and they wouldn’t let me in. I’m tired, stuck with a floor to sleep on. I call Southwest Airlines 1800 number lady tells me she can’t refund my money because I’m attached to my bags. I’m told by other customer after Storm was over many other flights took off. Yet we were canceled. I took lyft to drive us to Oklahoma city.  Now its 6.24 I need to figure out how to get my bags and rental car. what a nightmare I'm so upset with Southwest Airlines right now, they left me stranded, and for some reason decided our plane was canceled while others continued to leave to their destination."
954," |  We had a flight from San Antonio to Colorado to Vegas for Thursday at 7:45pm we had a wedding to get too. Our flight got delayed so we wouldn’t be flying out till 11:30. We sat at the airport all night for a few hours and then They offered all of the passengers $100 vouchers. As we went to get our $100 vouchers they said our flight was canceled it would be too late for us to leave from Colorado to Vegas when it landed so they said they Can re book us. They rebooked us to fly out of San Antonio BUT they split us up and we all are having to arrive at separate times ranges from early morning to late afternoon. We lost a night of a hotel we had already paid for because the hotel wouldn’t let us save our night for another one. We missed the wedding we were going for and one of our friends was stuck without a hotel since we wouldn’t get there till the next day to check In for her since it was underneath one of our names. Very disappointed they did a horrible job in accommodating us for the horrible experience we had. The lady said it’s out of her hands and we can either re book or leave it alone. Southwest Airlines has done nothing to make us feel like we didn’t lose out on time, hotel money and food and our friend was left stranded alone in the Vegas airport for a whole night."
984," |  Due to the terrible storms that recently took place in Dallas, Texas, I was unable to travel to California for two days. The flights the following days, of course, were full since everyone had rescheduled, and I had to cancel my trip. I was traveling on American Airlines to California first, and then Southwest from Burbank to San Jose Airport. Because I could not get to California in time to catch my Southwest Flight, I had to cancel it. It was canceled two days before I was to leave (April 7 canceled). I then received an email at the time the flight was supposed to take off in Burbank that said I had not canceled the flight and that I would lose all my money because I had not canceled it before the time of departure. The huge storms in Dallas were not my fault, and Southwest should have at least credited my account for a future flight. Nearly all other airlines do this. They refused to do this. I won't be flying them anymore. There service has become increasingly worse during recent years, and there pricing policies (e.g., the business seats scam we all know about) are byzantine."
985," | Grand Rapids to Las Vegas. Very disappointed. First, they cancelled my flight 3 days before leaving. They informed me by automated call that it was cancelled but, I could have my money back. No offer of alternate flights, nothing and, I went through a travel agent! They hung up when we tried to book other flights. Offered nothing in return of losing most of a vacation day. Then, coming home more delays and a “sorry” over the speaker at the airport. How about a ticket, discount, drinks, premium seating? Nothing. Southwest needs to work on customer service!"
989," |  Chicago to Oakland. Southwest cancelled our flight going and coming home. Instead of trying to help their customers they just leave them without options. Within minutes every flight was sold out. When they cancelled our flight flying out, I called and the customer service rep said my flight coming home would not be cancelled. It was and I was not able to get another flight for two days which was not possible due to a connecting flight. We had to go with another airline that could accommodate us. It cost allot of extra money and time. Southwest could have cared less. Then when I had to cancel the flight I booked two days later after I asked if I would get a full refund if I could get another flight, they tried to charge me anyway. It is unbelievable the lack of customer service they have provided this trip. I’m not understanding why they couldn’t just get another plane to put all of these customers on and leave them where they are rather than just leave them with nothing to fin for themselves. As of now I am considering never flying with them again and cutting my southwest card up. They never once tried to make the situation better. It’s really sad they are treating their loyal customers this way. You need a better system Southwest when you cancel flights. For me personally, I’m scared to ever book a flight with you again. I was really worried about how my family and I were going to get home at the LAST MINUTE."
997," | 
I just wanted to share my recent experience with Southwest so that people can make informed decisions and know what they are getting themselves into when they book with them. I did not have a good experience with Southwest Airlines. I received an email from Southwest on Wednesday night indicating that my Thursday morning flight back from Boston to Denver had been cancelled due to weather. I had heard from my brother-in-law, who used to fly Southwest frequently, that they had a very strict weather cancellation policy, so out of curiosity, I went to check if all flights into Denver were cancelled, or if Southwest was just falling back on their strict weather cancellation policy. I found that both JetBlue and Spirit flights were still scheduled to arrive in Denver on time, which would lead me to believe that although Denver airport conditions may not have been ideal, they were safe enough for commercial airlines to fly in. Denver International Airport was even indicating that they had 4 of their 6 runways open. I called the number Southwest included in their flight cancellation email to reschedule my flight. After waiting on hold for about 1.5 hours, I was disconnected, so I called them back immediately only to wait on hold for 2 more hours. Once I was finally able to get through to a customer service representative to reschedule my flight, the representative told me that the absolute soonest flight they could get me on was not until Sunday, 4 days later. My husband and I had plans to go up to the mountains for the weekend and flying back into Denver on Sunday would have caused us to miss our entire trip. So I called AMEX Travel, as I had booked through them initially, and they were able to get me on a United flight leaving Saturday…one day earlier than the Southwest flight. At this point I was really wishing I would have booked with JetBlue or Spirit, as now I would be stuck in Boston an additional 3 days that I had not planned for. This means 3 more nights in a hotel, 3 more days of having to purchase food, and 3 more days of missing work. If this wasn’t inconvenient enough, my husband and I were also not going to be able to make our trip to the mountains, which we had already planned. Just for fun, I added up all the costs that stemmed from Southwest cancelling my flight. Hotel: $150/per night x 3 nights = $450 (prices had gone up over the weekend due to the St. Patrick’s Day holiday) Food: about $10/meal x 9 meals = $90 Missed days of work: $22/hr x 24 hrs (3 8 hr workdays) = $528. Total amount lost due to Southwest cancelling my flight because of their “strict weather policy” = $1,068 (this is not including the money that was already spent on our trip to the mountains that we were not able to take). I don’t know many people who can afford to just lose out on that amount of money. Southwest did end up refunding my cancelled flight, which naturally they should, considering they cancelled it. In addition, when I called in to see if they could offer any other kind of compensation, they offered me a $150 Southwest flight voucher. They indicated that because the flight was cancelled due to weather, the cancellation was out of their control and is not their fault. I beg to differ. JetBlue and Spirit did not cancel their flights, so clearly, the cancellation was due to some policy Southwest has that JetBlue and Spirit do not.,"
998," | I flew to MO from NY for my sons Army graduation. We had booked a return flight from MO to NY on 3/15/19 at 8:15 which was delayed until 10:00 then cancelled. I was told it was due to the weather and I would not receive a refund. After speaking to 3 different people I was finally told our flight was cancelled due to safety issues. My family and I had to purchase different tickets through American Airlines because Southwest told us that they wouldn’t have anything for another 2 days. One of the Southwest representatives said that they would return $311.96 per person, gave me a receipt told me it would return to my credit card within two days which was a lie. I spent over $2000 on a rental car and new tickets in order to get home for work thinking I was getting my money back, as I was told. I will no longer be flying Southwest, the customer service is terrible!"

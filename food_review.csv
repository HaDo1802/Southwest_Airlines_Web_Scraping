11," |   This airline made it impossible to sit with your spouse. Sharing the food we brought was also not possible. Bad open seating policy. When you board the plane, you get whatever seat is left over."
91," |   My flight itself was great. From Cincinnati to Chicago we were offered a snack and a drink. I had asked for a diet Coke. I didn't get mine. I was skipped on that one. I got a snack though. I just thought they were busy so I let it go. Then from Chicago to Memphis we were again offered a snack and what we wanted to drink. I got my snack but again, I didn't get my drink. Luckily, I had a 20oz in my pure. Although it was hot, at least it was wet. I watched the airline worker give two bags of snacks to customers. Not a bag, it was about estimated 20 or more in a bag. It was huge. I thought so if you tell them you like the snacks, they give you 20 or more bags for free! I had to let them know when I was getting off the plane not only did I not get my drink on either flight I was on today. I guess I just looked like I didn't or was thirsty! I have had much better service on different airlines. Southwest is a thumbs down for me."
120,"  The day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from Houston to San Diego. We noticed the change reduced our layover to 40 minutes, so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict. We arrived 6 hours before our scheduled time, so I stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the over-worked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didn't see anything that was better. This phrase came up a lot, but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they don't have control of the weather, etc. regarding delays. The only flights from Southwest that were delayed were those to San Diego (it was not weather related as the flights to and from San Diego were also on schedule except ours). After waiting until we could check luggage (4.5hrs), we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended (5 minute layover). Agent 2 told me that she could only find another flight with 1 seat headed to Boise, but she could only see Houston connections, so I called their 800 number. 3rd agent was an explanation followed by hold/hang-up. 4th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option, but because we checked baggage #4 (the only person willing to help us) had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information. 5th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from San Diego to Boise has 17 passengers and is going to wait for us. I asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection, but that would be unfair to everyone else, so we sat in the back. I knew I was being lied to, but at this point I figured I'd just wait to see what would happen. We fly to San Diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a $100 voucher for a later flight (YAY!). I looked at my pass and it was an ""A"" position which was nice and handed off the other 3 for our family to my wife and went in search of food (terminal was super crowded due to construction) so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit. I mentioned how it was nice that we didn't get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was C-30 and his girlfriend was C-15. I took our passes to the 7th agent (6 was for new passes) and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together. She immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers. I stated that my original tickets were in the A group for that leg of the flight (in an irritated voice), but she stuck to her argument. At this point, I was done with their service, so I expressed to her that I had spent the better part of 12 hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored. She threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor. The supervisor #8 and I had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness, but she would allow us to board together. She mentioned the $100 vouchers, but why would I ever fly with them again - I'd pay not to (and told her so). She also asked why I didn't ask for a supervisor - Isn't that their job when they can't help a customer? Flying with Southwest is just not worth the trouble. They get a 2 rating because their flight staff is actually amazing!"
129," |  Flight attendant was saving good seats for people that she decided she wants. Many people (not just my group) tried to sit in the seats but she blocked the seats with her body and gave all kinds of excuses as to why each person shouldn’t sit there. When she saw people that she liked, she unblocked the seats and told them to sit there. I don’t know how she decides who deserves the good seats, but i paid $100 for Earlybird check in (me and my wife) so that we would have choice of the better seats. Two other people in my group upgraded for the same reason but they couldn’t get the seats either. And one of those people have hip, knee and back issues and upgraded so that he would have a chance at the good seats (two knee replacements, one hip. replacement and multiple back surgeries) The whole point of paying extra/upgrading, is to get those seats. I feel jipped. And I really hate to say this but there was some kind of favoritism going on.  Furthermore there was another flight attendant that many people said was rude and condescending. People throughout the flight were trying to get to the front lavatories. The 2 rude flight attendants told several people that the restroom was closed. I understand that they were working in that area preparing our drinks and snacks, but they were very rude to my wife and several others when telling them to go use the other lavatories. I was sitting near the front with my wife and we watched these 2 flight attendants throughout the flight. Everyone sitting near us was watching and talking about the situation too. There was one flight attendant that was very kind and polite though."
131," Canceled flights after making everyone wait both in the boarded plane that wasn't moving for 4 hours (with AC off) took us off and told us to wait, 4 hours later they canceled the flight and did not give us food or a place to stay until the next available flight (all the ones for the rest of the evening were already booked)."
133," | Upon family boarding my daughter and I sat in the first 2 rows of the aircraft, we boarded the plane early. I put both our carry ons above us. I was soon interrupted by an un-helpful, nasty flight attendant stating you need to get you bag up or I have to check it. I quickly got my bag in and it fit fine, the woman watched me struggle with no help. Then after the plane had fully been boarded someone boarded the plane that also wanted their carry on to fit, my bag was then removed and placed further in back to place their bag where mine was. After drinks were served my daughter and I weren’t able to finish our drinks as a different flight attendant wanted to take our garbage and said we weren’t allowed to finish our drinks. When we were leaving the plane I asked the flight attendant where my bag was and I was told they didn’t know, and now I we had to wait until the entire aircraft un-boarded so I could get my bag. Once I was able to locate my bag it was in the exact position it originally was in but further back in the aircraft. My daughter and I were treated very poorly as we exited the aircraft by the flight attendant with a snarky, condescending tone “have a nice day”. Not sure how I feel about flying Southwest anymore with my family. We spent a lot of money on tickets and if we boarded early our bags should have had priority over the late comers and we should have been able to finish our drinks, and throw the garbage out when ready."
149," |  In 2007 Southwest served: 64.9 million cans of soda, juices, and water 11.3 million alcoholic beverages 6.1 million bags of pretzels 103.8 million bags of peanuts 14 million snackpacks 32 million other snacks Just think how much money Southwest would save if they stopped offering all those ""free"" drinks but then the public would go crazy.  Our beverage service has been canceled on probably 8 out of the last 10 flights I have been on.  And no I don't fly the same place so its not likely due to a specific route. But - if you do the math - Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year.  An average soda costs about $0.75 - $1.00 for the airlines, once you factor in the cost of the drink itself (they purchase cans), the cup, and the ice (which isnt much).  On average a flight has about 150 passengers - that's easily $112 - $150 they can put in their pocket when they ""cancel"" beverage service - and that's assuming each passenger only has one drink. On a recent flight (the one I'm on as I write this) - we were once again denied this ""freebie"" service in the name of supposed ""turbulence"" despite a relatively smooth flight.  I've heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision, so I asked. When I asked about this, instead of simply answering my question, letting me know that the captain made the decision, etc. the flight attendant said something like ""let me find out"".   A few minutes later, the captain came on and ""explained"" why he felt it was important to cancel service - essentially providing an excuse for why they did this.  When I asked for the captain's name, so i could verify this with SWA customer service, I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me ""were not going to do that"" and refused to give me his name. He also threatened that they would ""divert the plane""  although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat, not yelling or anything.  I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear - can't have more than one passenger figure out the little secret. Although I dont know what they are so worried about.  Most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience, let alone do anything that could actually make a difference (like report this on social media or via customer service). But still you dont have to ""hide"" and refuse to provide your name if you aren't doing anything wrong.  So this is all being done in the name of ""safety"" - lets go with that. "
219,  We were supposed to catch a flight from Denver to San Diego at 6:10 PM. When we got to the airport the flight kept getting delayed. At one point it was supposed to leave at 8:30 pm. We went to get dinner since we had time to wait. Then they moved it back to 645 pm so we had to get our food to go before it was even made to try and catch the flight. We then went to the new gate that our flight was supposed to be at and waited. All of the sudden we got notified that the gate moved again. We got ready to move to the next gate and then we were told by a southwest attendant working there that our flight was canceled. So in sum we’re now headed back home without our luggage after a very long day at the airport that took us nowhere. Terrible experience.
245,"  So unorganized as a whole. Delayed flights, short staffed, no drinks. Unassigned seating is so stupid and the seats are tiny. You get what you pay for."
258," |   couldn't fly because he had to many hours, so we were made to leave the tarmac and go back to the gate. While we waited for over an hour with no air conditioning, nothing about the passengers. Our flight arrived 2 hrs late. I was offered no food or drink the entire time we waited, nor while in the air.  What is wrong with your company and employees? "
322,"  Southwest post COVID is a complete disappointment. They were known for customer service and were the last to come to the party with positive customer service and drink service after the pandemic. It is clear that morale among flight attendants is low - not sure if that is due to corporate support or employee entitlement after COVID. I have switched to Delta and United for all business travel and now fly SW only for price necessity. I was a very loyal customer for years and now feel no loyalty at all. Prices are not worth it. Late flights, SW waits too long for delayed passengers - how does it make sense to hold up 200 (ish) passengers for 5 people? I have been on both sides and would have understood if flight had to leave. Today we waited 45 minutes for 5 passengers, all of whom boarded in the first 30 minutes. Why the extra 15 min? Previously delightful attendants now act put out and entitled. Prices aren’t as competitive as they were historically. What a shame - used to be such a great company."
350,"  Worst flying experience of my life. Trying to get home from Salt Lake City to Fort Myers Florida, sheer hell. Flight from SLC to DEN was delayed then cancelled. Which caused us to have to stay overnight and SW did not pay for any accommodation’s. Had to pay for hotel, food and then more cash for airport food. Southwest rescheduled a flight to get us home which caused us to have to get up at 3.30 am to catch a flight by 5.30 am only to find when we got at the gate that the flight was not going straight to Midway Michigan as was on the ticket, no. We were going to Houston, take off land, deboard all those passengers, onboard all those passengers. Then fly to Panama City, deboard, onboard passengers, then to Midway. 10 hours sitting on a plane with only 2 bags of snacks since 3.30 am in the morning. Then arrive at Midway to find that flight was delayed. Then delayed again. Finally boarded that flight and made it home after 2 days of sheer hell with Southwest who could not have cared less. None of the employees cared less. Plane was so cold the man sitting next to me called it a meat locker. I had to stay wrapped in fleece and blankets and scarves. No one cared. Their employees are immune to everything because this happens all the time and I’m sure they get screamed at all day. But customers can’t even speak up for fear you will be considered unruly. Ruined what was a wonderful vacation to Moab. We will never use Southwest again. If you want them to screw up you life for days then this is your airline."
373, | I arranged Nashville to Las Vegas travel thru Southwest. It was a special occasion and purchased Business Select ticket and paid premium price. Only thing I got additional is to check in quick and one drink coupon for each traveler (it is $7.00/ per drink if you buy your own). This is total disappointment and not worth to by Business Select.
375," |  They don't assign seats. If there's an issue how do you know whose in what seat. My main issue was I wasn't feeling good after we landed and I asked for ginger ale and the flight attendant said ""we don't give drinks out after we land. It wasn't like I was asking for a beer. The flight was delayed but yet the monitors said on time. When they finally told us the flight was delayed, they said it's possible we will board on time so don't leave the area. If we are delayed how can we board early?b You don't have to worry about me flying your airline again. For $1300 it's a waste of money. Couldn't get Wi-Fi nor any entertainment. It wouldn't work."
398,"  I was a loyal southwest fan for 25 plus years. No more. After this fiasco of them cancelling flights I am done. Offered no hotel voucher no food voucher after waiting 4 hours in a line only to be told what I could have done myself. Offered to book us 4 days later on a flight - 4 days! We cancelled and got refunded and will now use competitor airlines. Let my wife, myself and our 2 kids down. Gone are the fun friendly customer service winning days at Southwest. Avoid them at all costs."
448,"  Our flight going to Chicago, number 3134 on 1/6 2022, 6.25am. The attendant was very rude, my sister is handicapped, she is 69 yrs old. She asked the staff member if someone could put a carry on up above for her. The attendant sarcastically said if its too heavy you should check it in, so another passenger helped us. Our flight coming home was flight 1547, 1/9/22. Our attendants were sarcastic, they rolled their eyes when we asked for 2 drinks. If your employees are not happy they need to get other jobs. When we were at Tampa Airport Southwest counter, it was early but the ladies at the counter were not happy answering my questions. Yes it was 4am but its their job to answer our questions. Just rude, sarcastic and didn't want to be bothered. I am a customer paying for my flights, if they don't want to work early, then don't. I am not happy with how my sister and I were treated. "
450," | First, we stood in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes before we were able to even get to the counter flying Business Select then another 15 plus minutes to get checked in as the customer service rep looked all around instead of paying attention to what he was doing. It took 5 scans of each of our passports, 2 of us were traveling together. People were moving others to the front of the business line for tips. 1 counter working A List passengers that pay more for expedition to begin with, and we were solicited to tip more to get us to the front of the line. No way! Then we were given a free drink coupon for our flight. Beer, wine or liquor was valid for the day of travel only and only for Southwest Airline, this was rejected by attendant with ""We haven't had alcoholic beverages for over two years now, then he chuckled"". A non alcoholic beverage offering at that time would have been nice, but no offer. We had already had coffee and soda, so maybe one drink allowed. This is the worst experience ever flying. Why should I pay for business class if it does not benefit me. We boarded behind wheelchair passengers and their extended families who miraculously were able to travel walking when landed due to no wheelchairs available yet at the gate. Three of 9 remained seated waiting for assistance. I have no problem waiting for those three, at all. This makes me question if I will ever fly Southwest again, but I will never pay for Business Class again with them, regular boarding took well over 2 hours to check in for the flight. There were at least 5 counters to serve other class boarding. The security process took way less time as they screened everyone's bags and persons. This is an economy type airline, thankfully it was the non-stop destination option. Beware, if you fly with them, keep your money in your pocket and don't bother with A list, business or first class, you just threw away your money."
484, | Absolutely the worst experience I’ve ever had at an airport/with an airline. We got to the airport at 1pm for a 4.35pm departure. We were moved to 3 different lines and eventually at 3.0pm we reached the ticket counter. When we reached the front of the line they then took people behind us that were on a flight that departed 10 minutes before ours. No one knew what was going on and the extra time we wanted to use to get food and other items was now gone and we had to rush to our gate.
495," | Never have I ever been so poorly treated by Southwest Airlines. My husband and myself were supposed to leave Las Vegas headed back to Indianapolis on Monday Nov 1st at 6am. Instead we got a late email at 7pm October 30, informing us that are flight is cancelled and we won’t be able to fly out until the next day at 9.40 with a layover. Southwest refused to accommodate us with a hotel, food nor a different flight to a city close to Indianapolis. We had just found out we lost our grandmother and couldn’t get home. Instead they offered a 100 love flight voucher as if that would cover another night at the Aria or food and drinks for another full day stay. We had to miss an extra day of work and had to pay an extra day of child care because we had no other way of getting to our children. No way of getting to our family when they needed us the most. Southwest left us with no options and they didn’t care. The service coordinators were unhelpful, I’ve never been so poorly treated in my life. I’d never recommend anyone to fly them ever again. You all should be a ashamed of yourselves. "
503," |  I have now contacted Southwest 3 times with no satisfaction. Five members of my family were stranded in Chicago on their way to Florida due to canceled flights. After 3 days a family member drove to Chicago, 4 hours away to pick them up. Their luggage was returned 10 days later. The compensation for that was 1 $150 voucher. In a response to the canceled flights, the response was basically, it’s not our problem. They were out over $1000 in hotel and food bills plus the cost of loss time for someone to pick them up. Southwest sent a $150 voucher. I guess 5 people are supposed to split that. I am very disappointed with Southwest and their lack of consideration for the people who make this airplane profitable!"
519,  Never ever flying Southwest again. They cancelled our flight last minute and we were told they can’t fly us home until two days later. When we asked for a hotel they said “all of our hotels are booked.” I demanded to speak with the manager who took 30 mins to come talk to us and acted like it was a big deal to get us a hotel. This airline refused to give us a credit to fly home today through another airline. We asked if they could fly us to somewhere near our home and they simply said “we don’t have anything.” Worst experience and ruined our vacation. Not only did we have to call off of work but we had to spend extra money for food and ubers.
549," |  I will start by saying I rode comfortably for the 4 hour flight. The staff on the flight was very courteous as well. Although drinks and food were limited, this is what we have come to expect in a post COVID world. It was after the flight that there were problems. We had to wait an hour and a half for our checked bags to make it to the baggage claim. There was no explanation given other than sorry, the guys in the back getting luggage up here is put of my hands. When you are getting in at midnight and having to work in the morning an extra hour and a half is a big deal."
552," |  Flight to Orlando was quick with chips and small shared cup of drink.  My return flight experience was so so below par. They cancelled my 9:30pm from Orlando to Indy just 1 hr to boarding that I already arrived at airport after changing and changing time and I didn't bother and they rebooked me to 7:35am following morning I woke up with my wife and 1 year old and 4 years old girls at 4:30am just to be prepared after leaving to airport they cancelled my flight again and rescheduled me to 11:45. Instead of direct flight they put us on 7hrs 50 minutes, 1 stop flight and I was supposed to resume work. I went to claim my luggage and my bag is damaged."
578," |  I booked flights for a group of 23. How is it that you would not allow our transfer flight to Houston to wait 10-15 more minutes for us to get off the flight from Las Vegas to return home. If there would have been communication with the flight from Las Vegas - they could have allowed us 23 to get off to head to the gate for our connecting flight instead  - all 23 of us are here in Dallas until 6am. Your staff informed us it was weather related and we could not be comp. To have 23 customers (diabetics, heart patients, expecting mother, etc. with no meds) here is sad with no food or drinks because everything is closed is unsatisfactory. We were the only ones on this flight that was going to IAH.  Take better care of your customers. Not once was I advised via text message that the other delays were weather related. Yes, we did experience weather issues 30 minutes from arriving in Dallas. That would account for our flight arriving after 10pm, this information was provided by our pilot. So again, where is the communication break down? "
586," |  I thought Alaska was the worst but Southwest has taken the cake. Worst customer service, no follow through and does not take responsibility for there mistakes. Left my luggage behind in Phoenix even though I had to pick up and recheck my luggage, than I was told it would be brought to SLC the next day and they would call me. No call, I called twice for a call back and still no call back seems like they only respond to someone driving up to the airport and confronting them face to face. Will never fly with them again delayed flight, no Wifi, and they forgot our drinks, all that I was ok with, but not taking responsibility for there mistake and not following through on a simple call back I will not forgive. This is now my number one worst airline."
613," |  This trip has been awful. I am a college student and have summer classes I am traveling to. I booked my flight so that I would have enough time to get to my lodging location and finish a little homework before going to bed. When I arrived for my connecting I found out that my flight was canceled and I was not able to change the ""rebooked"" flight they had given me. The only reason they gave me for canceling the flight is the weather. There is no weather at my connection point or my destination. There is no weather between.  They would not give me a voucher for food or a hotel stating they don't do that for weather delays. I am now stuck at my connecting point for 8 hours waiting for the next flight to the destination. The airport I am stuck at does not have wifi and I have to use my hotspot that costs me money. Southwest would not let me change my destination, cancel with a refund, or change flight providers. When talking with the ticketing agent she also told me there is a high possibility that the ""rebooked"" flight will be canceled too. That means I will be at the airport until tomorrow with no voucher for a hotel, food, or wifi to do my homework. Southwest has used the ""WEATHER"" as an excuse so they don't have to give vouchers. There is no weather so don't say the cancelation is due to weather. They need to own up to the real issue. I am extremely fed up and will not be flying with them again if I have a choice."
639," | I used to love Southwest! Man, have they gone downhill. Let me preface my review that the pilots were amazing. Most of the stewards/stewardesses were obnoxious. They make every excuse to not provide food and beverage services. Checking in was an absolute nightmare! There was one staff member trying to direct hundreds of people, and he had no idea what he was doing! We arrived two hours early on our return flight and almost missed it because checking baggage was so disorganized! Will find another airline and hope they are better. One steward made the comment, ""It's time for us to get back to making money. The flight is full so don't protect seats."" Seriously?! There's a better way to convey that info! All of our flights were late, the second one by nearly two hours. My brand new luggage received a big ding to boot! Inexcusable!"
671,"  Absolutely horrible experience, I've flown 5 times since covid and you are the absolute worst. Flight was delayed 5 hours, and not once did we see anyone cleaning. There was no order to calling seats, section A was called but some B and C were allowed through at any time for no special reason other than getting in line before their turn and I use the word 'line' loosely, more like a cluster stampede. Masks were not enforced, people coughing unmasked. Tray on the back of the seat had sticky juicy all over it and the seat next to me, trash in pouch, obviously no cleaning. We were served open plastic cups that were carried on a tray down the isle that anyone not wearing their mask/ wearing it below their nose were breathing all over. Unboarding customers from the back were rude, unbuckled before we even stopped and then jumping to the front of the plane, instead of waiting your turn like it's always been. Stewards should be enforcing order from chaos. Plane was jam packed, no space in-between seats, strangers sitting right next to you taking off their masks to eat and drink. Keep in mind this also is a plane leaving Miami, Florida, 3rd highest covid state in the whole US."
700," | At the point of boarding the plane, I was verbally accosted by the gate agent who rudely embarrassed me by loudly stating I had too many carry on items to board the plane and that I needed to ""go over there and check something."" I politely tried to tell the woman that I had a bag with food for the flight and a fleece jacket in it. Didn't matter. I was accused of having a fanny pack when I was wearing a waist belt in lieu of carrying a purse. I had a mini backpack with chargers that per Southwest, are not supposed to be checked in baggage and a small suitcase. I was not given an opportunity to combine anything. I do not consider a waist belt, which I was wearing and is similar to a money belt or passport belt, to be a carry on item. It takes up no more space on my body than a belt on my pants. I never remove the waist belt and it does not impede sitting in a single seat or fastening my seatbelt. I do not consider food that I was going to eat in flight, especially as I was taking an antibiotic at that time for a GI condition, to be a carry on item. There were many, many other passengers who were carrying food on the plane in addition to other carry on items. I have never heard of a coat/jacket being considered as a carry on item. When I left Phoenix it was almost 90 degrees. When I arrived in Detroit 4 hours later, the temperature was about 45. To say a jacket/coat was necessary is an understatement. The gate agent was incredibly and unnecessarily rude. I was embarrassed unnecessarily in front of other passengers waiting to board. I have GI issues and cannot eat anything that might have been served in flight. Taking my own food on a 4 hour flight did not seem unreasonable. The mini backpack I had is about the size of an ordinary shoe box. Had I been given the chance, I would have combined items (except the waist belt) but I was denied that opportunity. I submitted a complaint to Southwest post-flight and received an email that in essence, blamed me for having so many carry on items, quoted a number of Southwest policies on baggage as if I do not know how to read and more importantly, failed to provide what I consider to be a sincere apology or any language about the gate agent receiving any kind of coaching, reprimand or training to correct her inappropriate behavior. In other words, it was all my fault. I am not ok with that. I have flown Southwest many times in the past and never had this kind of experience. I hope to never fly Southwest again. Public humiliation is uncalled for, period. Not being given a chance to ""fix"" my ""mistake"" and being ordered around rudely and loudly like a bad child is uncalled for. And to make matters worse, after we boarded the plane, we then sat in line with 24 planes ahead of us and took off 30 minutes late. Wow."
710,"  Last week, my husband and I flew Southwest to Orlando. Flight was good until the end. The flight attendant had the supervisors call the cops on us. There was 4 cops & 2 supervisors waiting for us in the gate when you walk off the plane. Obviously face masks are required during the flight, unless you were eating or drinking. During the flight, my husband fell asleep and I put my earbuds in and started drawing. He slept with a neck pillow and his face mask would catch on the pillow and slightly fall lower than his nose. The flight attendant woke him up a couple times and asked him to pull it back up. He apologized and went back to sleep. As far me, I went into my purse to grab 2 mints and a protein bar. I pulled my face mask down to put the mint in my mouth. The flight attendant snapped and told me to put my mask back on, I said I was eating. She said, “it’s only a mint and if this is going to be an issue, I’ll call the supervisor!” And stormed off. We land and get off the plane only to be greeted by the cops. The cops questioned us on what happened on the flight. The cop told us that face to face conflict/confrontation was reported from the flight attendant and that’s why they were called. The supervisor looked up our return flight and revoked them. All over sleeping and eating a mint. The flight attendant might have had a bad day but it’s not enough justification to go out of your way to wreck our trip. Her behavior is unacceptable. I understand you want to keep everyone safe. But you’re taking it too far. Not once did we raise our voice, or stand up and cause issues. Revoking our tickets over something this small, is unbelievable. If it’s that big of deal to eat on the flight, then stop serving water and snacks. Southwest, I want to truly thank you from the bottom of my heart for blowing things out of context and wrecking our trip. We cannot thank you enough for your unbelievable customer service."
720," |  The absolute worst experience! I have flown with SW about 12 times since the COVID disrupted our world. This day was humiliating to say the least! Once onboard I had my face mask on as requested. I had lowered the mask below my nose while my mouth was still covered to take a couple of deep breaths before take off. The female flight attendant was walking past and immediately reprimanded me. I quietly tried to explain what I was doing. Her response was that of a nazi ruler saying this wasn’t acceptable. During the 30’ flight it was time to take my prescription so I ate a snack so I wouldn’t take the medicine on an empty stomach and then took a drink of water. The entire time the attendant was just staring me down. Once we arrived HOU and I stepped off the plane the neo-nazi was standing there and pointed me out to her manager. They then said obviously my health needs wouldn’t be acceptable to fly with them and denied me to make my connecting flight, leaving me stranded 1300 miles from home!"
766,"  Chicago Midway to Denver. Adding my disappointment in what has been known as the airlines that have the best customer service and ""caring"" for their customers. I would expect them to take the lead on understanding and how they can help customers in these scary and challenging times. I also had an event canceled due to Coronavirus and it will not be rescheduled. So I will not be refunded. Or I can use this money for a year for something else, I guess I just pick a place to go to use the money, then also will have hotel and food fees, etc? we are not a family that can afford to just go somewhere to use this. Maybe something will come up that we have to go to in a year, who knows. But this has changed totally how I feel about Southwest Airlines and I will not choose them in the future.  American airlines refunded my friend for a cancellation due to Coronavirus. Wrong move Southwest, wrong move."
777," |  Horrible Customer Service. My husband and I went to Jamaica out of Tampa. Upon our return flight our flight was delayed for over 8 hours. We were given vouchers for food at the airport, flight credit and a hotel stay. We were told they will provide transportation to the hotel since we were getting back late. Long story short there were over 100 people waiting for transportation and they only sent 1 van for a total of 12 passengers. Southwest left us stranded at the hotel, we filed a complaint, was told wrong department and never got a follow up. This company just takes your money, gives false information and points the finger at everyone else and don't care about their customers. I would not recommend them to anyone."
791, |  Baltimore to Boston. Purchased a drink on flight. Should never have served the drink because they only gave us 5 minutes to drink it! Was told the receipt would be available online. It was not available on 2/12. Tried again today: entered confirmation code and flight dates and no receipt was found! Waited 20 minutes for a call back from SW (promised less than 15). First tier told me nothing could be done until Monday morning. Asked to speak to a manager. She said she could look it up on southwest.com. Why didn't the first tier offer that? She is still looking while I type this review.
812," | Houston to Denver via Dallas. I've even had better luck flying on United, and that's saying a lot considering United's abysmal reputation! To begin with my stories - Most recent flight, October 2019, Denver back to Houston: Unremarkable flight. Southwest check-in agent in Denver who collected my checked baggage was ""mechanically"" professional but lacked much in the way of personality. Upon arrival at Houston, baggage was oh, so slow to come out! Second most recent flight, October 2019, Houston via Dallas to Denver: Southwest check-in agent in Houston who collected my checked baggage was ""mechanically"" professional, again. Gate agents in both Houston and Dallas acted quite bored, honestly. I didn't notice the splotches of dried drink, food chunks and blood (yes, that is correct, blood) surrounding my seat until I sat down, and I had to sit down because I was one of the last people to board the plane. I sent Southwest a scathing review of that flight and got a $75 credit for a future flight for what it's worth. Third most recent flight, May 2019, Austin to Albuquerque then back to Austin: Any Southwest staff I interacted with at either airport couldn't be paid enough, it seems, to even bother to pleasantly interact with staff. That said, I remember the pilot on the first leg, from Austin to Albuquerque, trying to engage the passengers, so good for him! Fourth most recent flight, October 2018, Dallas to Louisville: The man who checked in my baggage at the curb barely said a word or even grunted, and even fairly forcefully threw said baggage onto the carousel even after I had told him that I have fragile items within! No ""thank you,"" no ""this is your ticket and go this way to your gate,"" nothing! Southwest's overall concept of customer service has plummeted over the last decade, and, after October 2019, I'll absolutely no longer fly them unless they are significantly cheaper than any competitor."
867,"  Las Vegas to Columbus. The Male flight attendant had a favorite row. He spent half the flight standing and talking to them. By the time we got out drinks our ""snacks"" (fritos and baby cookies) were gone because he was so busy playing favorites. Very unprofessional when I spent over 1000 dollars flying with you guys this trip. Never again."
892,"  Dallas to Denver. The staff taking drinks to people was nice, but I watched him talk to co-workers while people are looking around at least twice. $300 each way so $600 is a waste if you don’t have beverages."
903," |  Reno to Phoenix.  I would say Southwest is unreliable in terms of timing, especially out of Reno. Sometimes they are on time, but I can say without hesitation, there are other airlines who are more reliable in terms of timing. Also Southwest aircraft are not the cleanest (food on floor, dirt between seats, etc). That said, they are cheap, flexible, easy changes, good bag allowance, good staff. But timing is not their thing."
910," |  Absolutely ridiculous customer service. Don’t fly Southwest Airlines. Remember, you get what you pay for. If there are any issues that would require customer service assistance from this airline your done for. The nightmare initially begun on the 17th of July when I was scheduled to depart from St. Louis to arrive in Norfolk, VA. Arrive at the Southwest ticketing counter to learn my flight had been cancelled due to weather. Once I learned this, I asked the ticketing agent isn’t it protocol for someone to call, text, or email me the customer, to make them aware of the flight changes. The reply I got was priceless. Basically, my question was ignored. So, now the ticketing agent begins to look in order to rebook my flight. Now, they book me a flight for the very next morning. However, this time I will have to fly from St Louis to Cleveland, OH, then to Chicago, Illinois and then onto a Norfolk. Of course, I accept the reservation thinking all has been resolved and there would be no more issues. So approximately hours later I arrive back in St. Louis airport. I board the first flight from St. Louis thinking I’m finally on my way to my destination and I would be good to go. The plane lands arriving in Cleveland with the pilot coming on the speaker stating, “there’s a weather delay and no one can get in or out of Chicago”!  After sitting in Cleveland for almost four hours until finally being cleared for take off to continue the journey now to Chicago and then Norfolk. Finally, land in Chicago approximately three hours after my Southwest connection flight had already departed for Norfolk. I immediately go to Southwest customer service counter to explain what I just went through. First, I’m told all remaining flights are booked going to Norfolk. I’m also told that they can fly me to Baltimore, Maryland the next day, which would be the third day! And I’m also told when I get to Baltimore I would have to be on standby in order to try to get a flight to Norfolk. Now, my frustration is beginning to show. I ask if I would be provided a hotel here in Chicago and I was told no. So, I get no hotel, no later flight, and absolutely nothing at all in order to make up for this inconvenience. Not even a bag of peanuts or even a drink. I always knew this was a suspect airline. However, take it from me. Save your money and go United or Delta. If you don’t and something happens. In my case weather!!! Then, your just throwing your money away. I understand weather is not the airlines fault. However, it’s how the customer service takes care of their customers during that inconvenience is what is being measured. I’m a customer who definitely learns from their mistakes. In short, no one should have to experience this, especially in a strange unfamiliar city and then get told that the best they can do is have me sleep on the floor in the airport and then ride to another strange city to then be placed on standby for the final destination"
913,  Atlanta to Las Vegas. I would never fly with this airline ever. First the flight pattern was changed. Just as we were getting ready to board the took our plane and sent it to Ft Lauderdale. Then we had to wait for them to locate us a plane. Now I paid for a direct flight. We had to first go to St Louis at which point we were not to change planes. We were taxiing in to unload those not going on with us and we were told to change planes. Then we had to go to Austin prior to Vegas. Now they only offered us food in a snack pack of mini pretzels (child size snack pack). While waiting in Austin to board additional people. The staff were begging no one to open window shades as the A/C was not working properly. It was over booked and very hot. 8 hrs later we land in Las Vegas starving and tired and hot. This airline could careless about our first experience with them
954," |  We had a flight from San Antonio to Colorado to Vegas for Thursday at 7:45pm we had a wedding to get too. Our flight got delayed so we wouldn’t be flying out till 11:30. We sat at the airport all night for a few hours and then They offered all of the passengers $100 vouchers. As we went to get our $100 vouchers they said our flight was canceled it would be too late for us to leave from Colorado to Vegas when it landed so they said they Can re book us. They rebooked us to fly out of San Antonio BUT they split us up and we all are having to arrive at separate times ranges from early morning to late afternoon. We lost a night of a hotel we had already paid for because the hotel wouldn’t let us save our night for another one. We missed the wedding we were going for and one of our friends was stuck without a hotel since we wouldn’t get there till the next day to check In for her since it was underneath one of our names. Very disappointed they did a horrible job in accommodating us for the horrible experience we had. The lady said it’s out of her hands and we can either re book or leave it alone. Southwest Airlines has done nothing to make us feel like we didn’t lose out on time, hotel money and food and our friend was left stranded alone in the Vegas airport for a whole night."
985," | Grand Rapids to Las Vegas. Very disappointed. First, they cancelled my flight 3 days before leaving. They informed me by automated call that it was cancelled but, I could have my money back. No offer of alternate flights, nothing and, I went through a travel agent! They hung up when we tried to book other flights. Offered nothing in return of losing most of a vacation day. Then, coming home more delays and a “sorry” over the speaker at the airport. How about a ticket, discount, drinks, premium seating? Nothing. Southwest needs to work on customer service!"
999," |  I had a change of last name that I e-mailed well back in Jan 2019. Upon requesting how to get my last name change, I was not informed that I should also include any upcoming flight reservation numbers. That being said, only my Rapid Rewards profile was updated on the site, nothing else. I didn't know what to make of this by the time I went to fly out. I was allowed to fly with my old married last name with no issues, but was almost left to not be allowed to get on the plane from Austin because my ID didn't match my boarding pass name. This caused me to nearly miss my flight and I rushed to the gate losing 4 items!  I've never in my life lost so many items in my life- especially not all at once! I was incredibly flustered. I lost 2 items at Austin, one on a plane going to Nashville, then at the Nashville Airport before boarding my flight back to Chicago. The incorrect last name was Baker instead of Anderson. I called to their Customer Service headquarters to where the best they could do was offer me a voucher of $100. That's not even enough for a free flight (round trip) to anywhere! They seriously don't care about their customers because aside from using this voucher, I will no longer be using their flight services again. I didn't even get a promised drink from Nashville into Chicago. I also landed without a jacket (because this was one of my 4 lost items) and ended up freezing. I've reported my lost items twice! TWICE! Because after you call in to report a claim of a lost item, they insist that you fill out a document of theirs to be submitted via e-mail on top of it. This company makes all sorts of excuses as to why they won't do anything further. They say that they had no idea I had an upcoming flight based on my RR#. I had no idea they even needed it! So, they can't point blame on me. What happened to the ""Customer's always right!"" attitude? I'll be taking my business elsewhere and I recommend everyone else does the same! I get that they are not responsible for lost items; however, I would not have lost any of those items if I hadn't been flustered to missing my plane to begin with- so yes, it is their fault when I've never lost anything at airports in my life! I'm very disappointed in this airline company and I cannot wait to use their voucher to just move on to another airline company."
